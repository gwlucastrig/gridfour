 * Describes whether the geometry associated with each value in the
 * raster should be interpreted as a single point value or an overall
 * value for an area.  The notion of a value geometry is embedded into many
 * raster data formats, such as the GeoTIFF standard's PixelIsPoint and
 * PixelIsArea settings. It allows an application to precisely specify
 * how a value is derived for an arbitrary point on the surface described
 * by the raster.
 * <p>
 * Unfortunately, not all data authors indicate which form is used.
 * In such cases, if you cannot determine the appropriate representation
 * through deduction (looking at the number of rows and columns with
 * respect to the area of coverage), you may have to resort to guesswork
 * or use the "Unspecified" value of this enumeration.
