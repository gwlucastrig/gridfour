/**
 * Provides classes related to the creation, display, and processing of images.
 * Although Gridfour is not an image-processing library, the ability to depict
 * raster data in the form of images is essential to verifying the correctness of
 * implementation and inspecting data. Therefore, the Gridfour API includes a
 * set of simple rendering and image-manipulation tools.
