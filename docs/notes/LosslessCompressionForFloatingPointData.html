                    Lossless Compression for Floating-Point Data
                </p>

                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>
                    The Gridfour library implements a data compression technique that reduces many floating-point
                    raster data sets to about 50% of their uncompressed size while preserving the full
                    precision of the original data. The technique is relatively simple and requires
                    moderate computational resources. Because the Gridfour data compression technique is
                    <strong>lossless</strong>, it is suitable for applications that require faithful preservation of floating-point data in
                    its original form. Potential uses include data archival, distribution, and real-time processing systems.</p>

                <p>This article provides information about the Gridfour technique. It includes performance test
                    data for representative data sets and provides implementation details for the data format
                    used by the software. The notes included in this article should be useful to developers
                    who wish to apply the Gridfour library to their own applications or who wish to implement
                    their own data compression logic for floating-point data</p>


                <h1>Performance Testing</h1>

                <p>The effectiveness of the Gridfour floating-point data compression algorithms was tested
                    using elevation and ocean bottom depth data taken from the U.S Geological Survey
                    (USGS) Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) data products (USGS, 2019) and the GEBCO_2019 global
                    bathymetry and elevation data set (GEBCO, 2019). Although Gridfour is not limited to processing geophysical
                    applications, the availability of a large set of elevation data made these
                    products a convenient source of test data. Both products provide raster data
                    in grids with a uniform angular spacing (i.e fixed intervals of latitude and longitude). Each of the
                    high-resolution USGS products use a 1/3 second of arc spacing and cover a
                    1 degree square region. The lower-resolution GEBCO product covers the entire
                    Earth (land and water) and provides a raster data with a spacing of 15 seconds of arc <a href="#note1">[1]</a>.</p>

                <p>In the table, the regions of coverage for the USGS data are indicated by named locations.
                    All data values are given in bits-per-symbol (bits for elevation point) <a href="#note2">[2]</a>.
                    The data sources used for this test series were taken from files in either
                    the GeoTIFF or NetCDF data format, both of which implement their own techniques for
                    data compression. Thus the bits-per-symbol rates for the source files were
                    already less than the 32 bits that would be expected for the single-precision
                    floating-point data that they provided. Again, all three of the data formats cited
                    in the table are based on <i>lossless</i> compression techniques that preserve
                    the full precision of the original data. Better compression ratios are available
                    using <i>lossy</i> methods, but only at the cost of losing some information from the source data. </p>

                <p>As the table shows, Gridfour generally outperforms the better established data formats.
                    However, there are other, commercially available data compression implementations
                    that outperform Gridfour. Improving the Gridfour data compression ratios is an area of continuing research.</p>

                </table>


                <p>The table above refers to a metric called <i>entropy</i>. For purposes of this article,
                    we focus on <i>order-zero</i> entropy, which is based on the frequency with which
                    specific values occur in the raster set and is computed without regard to
                    observable trends or relationships between neighboring samples. From this perspective,
                    entropy can be thought of a measure of the amount of variability or complexity
                    in a data set.  Data grids with a lot of variability will have a high entropy value.
                    Data with little variability will have a low entropy value. In practice, the
                    amount of entropy in a data source is a good indicator of how well it should compress.
                    It is used here because it provides an objective way of characterizing the variability
                    of an input data set and rating the effectiveness of the data compression algorithm.
                    Entropy values are essentially the idealized average number of bits per symbol required
                    to encode the symbols (elevations, depths, etc.) in the source data based on certain
                    formal definitions.</p>

                <p>What we see in the table confirms that entropy is a rough predictor of the ability of the various
                    data compression schemes used by the three implementations (TIFF, NetCDF, and Gridfour) to reduce the
                    size of the original 32-bit floating-point values. In relatively flat regions, such as
                    Newport News, the entropy is lower and the data compression results in small outputs.
                    On the other hand, the State College PA sample features a series of alternating ridges and
                    valleys that lead to a much larger variability in the source data, a larger entropy value,
                    and a larger output size.  In the case of GEBCO_2019, the higher entropy is due both to
                    the variability of the terrain it covers and the wider spacing of sample points.
                    In practice, the larger the raster cell spacing, the more opportunity there is for a large change
                    in value from sample to sample.</p>

                <p>Entropy is an important consideration in data compression and information theory in general.
                    Readers who are interested in learning more about the concept of entropy (and Claude Shannon’s elegant
                    formulation of the idea) may refer to the Wikipedia article
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)">Entropy (information theory)</a>.
                    The entropy values shown in the table above were computed using the EntropyTabulator class which is
                    provided in the Gridfour project software distribution. </p>

                <h1>The Gridfour Technique</h1>
                <p>Floating-point data presents special problems for data compression implementations. Many of the
                    techniques that produce good results for integer forms exhibit lack-luster performance for
                    real-valued raster products. This characteristic led the Gridfour project to implement special procedures
                    for compressing floating-point data.</p>

                <p>The Gridfour technique does not actually break new ground, but is a refinement of ideas that were
                    used in the TIFF image-file format. So as an introduction to the Gridfour floating-point format,
                    we will begin with a brief look at its predecessor.</p>

                <h2>Differencing</h2>
                <p>Before processing data using a conventional compression algorithm, raster data formats such as TIFF
                    often apply a preprocessing technique known as differencing. To see how the technique works,
                    consider a raster consisting of two rows of sample values given as:</p>

                <pre>
    A, B, C,
    D, E, F
                </pre>

                <p>A typical differencing scheme would transform the data into a series of differences:</p>

                <pre>
    A, B-A, C-B,
    D, E-D, F-E
                </pre>

                <p>For integer-based raster data, the differences between subsequent samples
                    tend to be of smaller magnitude than the source data. They also tend to have reduced
                    variability (less entropy) and therefore compress more efficiently than the untransformed
                    representation of the data.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, differencing techniques do not work well for floating-point formats.
                    While they do reduce the magnitude of the data, they do not reduce the complexity
                    of the mantissa part of the floating-point representations. The TIFF data format
                    addresses this limitation by splitting the floating-point data into separate
                    bytes and performing differencing on the component bytes rather than the overall
                    values (Adobe, 2005).</p>

                <p>As we discuss bits and byte layouts, we will use the following conventions:

                    1. Bits are numbered according to their power of 2.  So the low-order
                    bit in a 32-bit integer or floating-point value is bit 0.  The
                    high order bit is bit 31.
                    2. Bytes are numbered starting with 0 for the low-order byte and 3
                    for the high-order byte.
                    3. The numbering schemes have nothing to do with byte ordering (little-endian
                    versus big-endian orders). They refer to the numeric positions of the
                    bits or bytes within the value being discussed.  Byte ordering is a necessary
                    consideration in implementation, but is not considered in this discussion of general idea.


                <p>The TIFF differencing proceeds as follows. For each row, the set of high-order bytes
                    (order-3 bytes) are ganged together, followed by the set of order-2 bytes,
                    order-1, and finally order-0. Within each gang, differencing is performed on a
                    byte-by-byte basis. For example, let A0 be the low order byte of floating-point
                    value A, A1 be the next higher order byte, A2 the one after that, and finally A3
                    be the highest order byte. The same pattern would apply for the next floating-point
                    value B in the sequence, which would consist of bytes B0, B1, B2, and B3.
                    We continue with values C, D, E, F, and so forth. In the TIFF format, the differencing
                    factors for floating-point values would be encoded as:</p>

                <pre>
    A3, B3-A3, C3-B3, (A2-C3), B2-A2, C2-B2, (A1-C2), etc.
    D3, E3-D3, F3-D3, (D2-F3), E2-D2, F2-E2, (F1-F2), etc.
                </pre>

                <p>Note that at the transition between rows, the literal (non-differenced) value is stored
                    as the first symbol. And, at the transition between byte sets, TIFF just continues with the previous value
                    (the transition pairs are marked by parentheses). Although these transition values are perhaps
                    not as optimal as they could be, the rows in actual raster data sets tend to be long enough
                    that their overall contribution to the entropy in the encoded bytes is small.</p>

                <p>The motivation for the TIFF approach is that floating-point data formats consist of three
                    parts &#8211; the sign bit, the exponent, and the mantissa &#8211; and each of these parts has
                    different statistical behavior. In general, the sign bits and exponents tend to have low
                    variability, while the mantissa components have high variability. By partitioning the source data
                    into separate sets of bytes, the TIFF approach arranges them in groups that have more uniform
                    behavior and can compress more readily.</p>

                <p>Once the bytes are separated into groups, the TIFF encoding scheme uses the
                    general-purpose LZW compression scheme to reduce the final size of the data.  LZW works
                    by recognizing patterns and redundant elements in the data stream and replacing them with more
                    compact representations.  The differencing transformation converts the original floating-point representations
                    (which have high variability, and thus low redundancy) to a form that yields more readily to
                    conventional compression.</p>

                <p>The TIFF approach has one important weakness.  By using byte boundaries as the division between
                    pieces, it combines some dissimilar components into the same group.</p>

                <p>Recall that the IEEE-754 single-precision floating-point format lays out the 32 bit format as follows:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>The sign bit (bit 31, the highest order bit)</li>
                    <li>The exponent (8 bits, bits 23 through 30)</li>
                    <li>The mantissa (23 bits, bits 0 through 27)</li>
                </ol>

                <p>In the TIFF approach, the sign bit and the 7 high bits of the exponent
                    are combined in the high-order byte group. The low bit from the exponent is combined with the 7 high bits
                    of the mantissa.  But because these separate components have different statistical properties,
                    combining them diminishes the ability of the compressor to reduce their size.</p>

                <h2>Gridfour Refinements</h2>
                <p>The Gridfour implementation refines the TIFF approach by dividing the components into 5 separate groups:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>The set of sign bits (packed into bytes, 8 bits per byte), no differencing applied</li>
                    <li>The set of exponents (bits 23 through 30) one byte per value, no differencing applied</li>
                    <li>The set of 7 high-order bits from the mantissa (bits 16 through 22), differencing applied</li>
                    <li>The set of 8 middle-order bits from the mantissa (bits 8 through 15), differencing applied</li>
                    <li>The set of 8 low-order bits from the mantissa (bits 0 through 7), differencing applied</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Once the floating-point data is separated into groups as described above, Gridfour uses the general-purpose Deflate
                    data compression API to reduce the data to a more compact form. Deflate is the compressor
                    used in the well-known Zip data compression utilities. Like the LZW compressor used by TIFF,
                    Deflate looks for repetition and redundancy in the data and uses compact representations
                    to achieve data compression. By partitioning the data into groups that are based on the nature
                    of the components, Gridfour improves the amount of repetition in the input byte sequence and thus
                    yields better results from the compressor.</p>

                <p>Each of the 5 sequences of bytes is processed through Deflate separately. Differencing is applied
                    only to some of the sequences. Where differencing is applied, the Gridfour floating-point encoder follows the
                    pattern that is used for its integer-based counterparts (see <a href="https://gwlucastrig.github.io/gridfour/notes/G93-Compression-Algorithms">G93 Compression Algorithms</a>).








                    In particular, differencing is used for all values sequence in the data and is not
                    limited to the length of a single row as it is in TIFF. Instead, the transition from row to row is handled
                    by referring the first value in the row to the previous row.</p>

                <p>The text below shows the general pattern of differences uses in all three mantissa sequences. In
                    this text, the letters A, B, C, etc. represent single bytes from within a particular sequence.</p>

                <pre>
	A,   B-A, C-B
	D-A, E-D, F-E
                </pre>

                <p>The text block below shows an example of statistics collected while processing the GEBCO_2019 data set.
                    The counts are the average number of bits used for each "tile" in the data set. A tile
                    is a subset of the overall data grid that consists of 90 rows and 120 columns of samples.
                    So before compression, the groups of Exponent and Mantissa components contain 90x120 = 10800 elements
                    (the sign bit group contains 10800/8 = 1350 elements). So in each case except for the sign bits,
                    the group started with a size of 10800 bytes and was reduced to something smaller by the
                    Deflate compressor.  The text shows both variations (with and without
                    differencing). As the data shows, had differencing been used for the exponents, it would have degraded the data
                    compression ratios. But for the mantissa components (M2, M1, and M0), it has a small advantage.
                    The magnitude of the component sizes also reflect the differences in variability for the different components.</p>

                <pre>
	Sign bits               26.90
	Exponent               222.22
	Exponent differencing  244.65
	M2                    3364.05    (high-order 7 bits of mantissa)
	M2 differencing       2810.71
	M1                    9978.12
	M1 differencing       8870.84
	M0                    8955.62    (low-order 8 bits of mantissa)
	M0 differencing       8857.40
                </pre>

                <p>The choice of whether a component group is processed using differencing is based on experimentation with a number
                    of data sets including elevation sources and artificial test data. So it is worth emphasizing that the
                    choice is not based on any formal theory of data compression, but was established through plain-old
                    trial-and-error. In view of that, the choices made for Gridfour may not be the optimal solution for all data sets.</p>

                    While the 2019 GEBCO data set featured non-integral data
                    given in the form of floats, the 2020 version released 28 April 2020, uses short (2-byte) integers.
                    With this change, the product now reports elevation and depth data rounded to the nearest 1 meter.
                    Because the data is no longer given in floating-point form, it is appropriate to compress the GEBCO 2020
                    product using the Gridfour integer compressor. The original 2020 data uses 16 bits per sample and has
                    a computed entropy of 12.9 bits per sample. The Gridfour integer data compression reduced the size of this set
                    down to 3.12 bits per sample.</p>
