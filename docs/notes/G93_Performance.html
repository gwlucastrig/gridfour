                    G93 Performance for Data Reading, Writing, and Compression
                </p>


                <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
                <p>The primary design goal for Gridfour&#39;s G93 module was to create an API that would
                    provide a simple and reliable interface for working with grid-based data sources.
                    And, in designing the G93 file format, we sought to develop a file-format specification
                    that would be stable across future versions, portable across different operating environments
                    and implementation languages, and suitable for long-term archiving of data.</p>
                <p>None of that would matter if the G93 software did not provide acceptable performance.</p>
                <p>This document describes the results of performance tests for the G93 software that were
                    aimed at assessing the usefulness of the implementation. The tests involved
                    performing various patterns of data access on two medium-to-large raster
                    data products.  The tests were performed on a medium-quality laptop with 16 GB of installed memory
                    and standard Solid State Drive (SSD).</p>

                <p>In evaluating the Java implementation for G93, we were interested in two
                    kinds of performance: speed of access and data compression ratios.
                    Statistics for these performance areas was collected using multiple
                    tests on large, publicly available data sets. The speed-of-access tests
                    included the time to write new files and
                    the time to read their entire content. The data-compression tests
                    focused on the effectiveness of
                    data compression for the reduction of storage size.
                    They also considered the processing overhead required for
                    applying data compression and decompression.</p>

                <p>A discussion of the results from the testing are given in the sections listed below:</p>

                <h2 id="test-data">The Test Data</h2>
                <p>We evaluated G93 performance using two well-known and easily obtained
                    geophysical data sets: ETOPO1 and GEBCO_2019.
                    These products provide world-wide elevation and ocean bottom depth information.
                    Because they describe a phenomonon that is readily observed in ordinary
                    experience, they have the advantage of familiarity and immediacy.
                    The data sets are large enough to present a significant processing
                    load for a test series. And their content is varied enough thoroughly
                    exercise the G93's function set.</p>


                <p>The following table gives physical details for the test data files. Grid dimensions
                    are given in number of rows by number of columns.</p>
                <table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10 style='border-collapse:collapse;border:none'>
                    <thead>

                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <p>Both of the test data sets are available free-of-charge on the web.
                    Both are available in different formats. For this test, we selected versions
                    of the files that were stored in the well-known NetCDF data format.
                    The ETOPO1 data is stored as 4-byte integers giving depth/elevation in meters.
                    Its values range from -10803 meters depth to 8333 meters height. The GEBCO_2019
                    data is stored as floating point-numbers in a moderately compact form that requires
                    just over 3 bytes for each data value.
                    Its values range from -10880.588 meters to 8613.156 meters.</p>

                <h2 id="performance-at-a-glance">Performance at a Glance</h2>
                <p>We'll begin our discussion of G93 performance by providing some of our most useful
                    information first. The table below is intended to sense of how fast G93 can
                    read from or write to a data file. The information in the table should provide
                    a basis for making a rough estimate of the kind of performance that can be expected
                    for other raster based data sources used in Java applications.</p>

                            <td>34.7 M/s</td>
                        </tr>

                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <p>Not surprisingly, the transfer rates for compressed data are substantially
                    slower than those for uncompressed. Data compression reduces
                    the number of bytes that have to be read from or written to an external storage medium
                    (such as a disk drive), but does not usually make a substantial difference in the
                    time required for file-access operations. The main difference in transfer rates
                    is due to the extra processor overhead required to compress or decompress data.</p>

                <p>The values in the table above include overhead factors such as the time
                    require to open or create a file. Naturally, there are other factors that
                    can influence access times. These are discussed in the sections that follow.
                    Details of the test methods used to measure performance are also included.</p>

                <h2 id="writing-the-data">Writing the Data</h2>
                <p>The G93 API can be used to simplify storage operations in data collection or analysis applications.
                    In those applications, it serves as a small part of a larger work flow. So it is reasonable
                    to require that the API does not make an undue contribution to the processing time for the overall job.
                    Therefore efficiency considerations were an important part of the G93 design.</p>

                <p>The time required for G93 to write the test data sets was measured using the
                    PackageData application that is included in the Gridfour software distribution.
                    That application transcribed the original NetCDF-formatted data into a matching
                    G93-formatted file. Naturally, reading a NetCDF file carries its own processing overhead.
                    The time required to access the original data was evaluated using a separate program
                    and removed from the data-writing statistics shown in the table below.</p>

                <table  border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10 style='border-collapse:collapse;border:none'>
                    <thead>

                        </tr>

                </table>


                <h2 id="reading-the-data">Reading the Data</h2>
                <p>Both of the test data products are distributed in the well-known NetCDF data format.
                    The data in the products is stored in row-major order, so the most efficient
                    pattern of access for reading them is one-row-at-a-time.</p>
                <p>The G93 data is intended to support efficient data access regardless of
                    what pattern is used to read or write them. Like the source data, the G93 test files
                    used for this evaluation were written in a row-major order.  So accessing
                    the G93 data on grid-point-at-a-time in row-major order would traverse the
                    file in the order that it was laid out.  Not surprisingly,
                    sequential access of the G93 files tends to be the fastest pattern of
                    access.</p>
                <p>In practice, real-world applications tend to process data from
                    large grids in blocks of neighboring data points. So they usually focus on a small
                    subset of the overall collection. The test patterns used for this evaluation
                    were based on that assumption. Except for the &quot;Tile Load&quot; case,
                    they involved 100 percent data retrieval.  The &quot;block&quot; tests
                    used the G93 block API to read multiple values at once (either an entire
                    row or an entire tile). Other tests read values one-at-a-time.</p>
                <p>The following table lists timing results for various patterns
                    of access when reading all data in the indicated files. Times are given in seconds.
                    Results are given for both the standard (non-compressed) variations of the G93
                    files and the compressed forms.</p>

                <h2 id="row-blocks-versus-row-major">Row Blocks versus Row-Major</h2>
                <p>The Row Blocks test reads each row of data in the source grid in
                    a single &quot;read&quot;. There are 10800 rows of data in the ETOPO1 product
                    and 21600 columns. Thus each block-read operation returns 21600 values.
                    This pattern of access is illustrated by the following code snippet</p>
                <pre><code>for (int iRow = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; iRow &lt; nRowsInRaster; iRow++) {
  <span class="hljs-type">float</span> []block = g93.readBlock(iRow, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, nColsInRaster);
}
</code></pre><p>In contrast the Row-Major operation reads the grid points for
                    each row one value at a time.   Internally, the G93File class
                    reads the data one tile at a time and stores them in a cache as necessary.
                    The &quot;read-value&quot; API determines which tile is needed and fetches
                    it from the cache each time the application requests a value. This pattern
                    of access is illustrated by the following code snippet:</p>
                <pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-type">int</span> iRow = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; iRow &lt; nRowsInRaster; iRow++) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-type">int</span> iCol = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; iCol &lt; nColumnsInRaster; iCol++) {
     <span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">sample</span> = g93.readIntValue(iRow, iCol);
  }
}
</code></pre><p>The Column-Major pattern is similar, but uses columns as the outer loop.</p>
                <pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-type">int</span> iCol = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; iCol &lt; nColumnsInRaster; iCol++) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-type">int</span> iRow = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; iRow &lt; nRowsInRaster; iRow++) {
     <span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">sample</span> = g93.readIntValue(iRow, iCol);
  }
}
</code></pre>
                <p>As these code snippets show, the Row-Major and Column-Major patterns
                    perform a separate read operation for each data point. Because each of these
                    read operations is independent, they involve a overhead
                    both for the Java method call and for the internal arithmetic to compute
                    an index into the grid and retrieve the associated tile from G93&#39;s
                    internal tile-cache. This small overhead was multiplied across the
                    numerous data read operations that were performed by these tests.</p>
                <p>The difference in data-fetching time between the Row-Major and Column-Major
                    access pattern is due to the fact that the tiles stored in the
                    particular G93 files used for this test were themselves written
                    to the file in row-major order (rows of tiles). So two tiles that
                    were adjacent in a single row were also adjacent in their file
                    locations. However, two tiles that were adjacent in a single
                    column were not adjacent in the file. This the Column-Major
                    pattern required more file seek-and-fetch operations than the
                    Row-Major alternative.</p>
                <p>In theory, the block retrievals should be faster
                    than the single-point read operations because fewer calls result
                    in less overhead. As the table above shows, the difference in the
                    operations was detectable, but not especially impressive. This result suggests
                    that the g93.readBlock() method may present opportunities for improvement.</p>
                <h2 id="the-cost-of-reading-data-from-the-file">The Cost of Reading Data from the File</h2>
                <p>The Tile Load test retrieves just one point for tile. Thus the run time for
                    the test is essentially just the time required to load read the individual tiles from
                    the data file.  The Tile Block test follows the same pattern as Tile Load,
                    but loads the entire content of the tile using the readBlock() method.
                    So the difference in time for the tests is just the overhead of indexing
                    and copying the data from the tile to the result array.</p>
                <p>At present, the Tile Block read times are significantly lower than those
                    of the Row Block test. Again, this result suggests that there may be
                    opportunities to optimize the access code for the read routines.</p>
                <h2 id="g93-versus-netcdf">Access Times for G93 versus NetCDF</h2>
                <p>As mentioned above, the source data used for the performance tests
                    described in these notes is distributed in a format called NetCDF.
                    G93 is not intended to compete with NetCDF. The two data formats
                    are intended for different purposes and to operate in
                    different environments. But the Java API for NetCDF is a well-written
                    module and, as such, provides a good standard for speed of access.
                    Any raster-based file implementation should be able to operate with performance that
                    is at least as good as NetCDF. </p>
                <p>The table below gives accessing times for reading the <em>entire</em> data set for
                    ETOPO1 and GEBCO_2019, using the Java API for NetCDF and G93 file formats.
                    Both files can be accessed in random order, but the most efficient way of retrieving
                    their content is by following a pattern of access established by their underlying
                    data definition. The NetCDF distributions of the ETOPO1 and GEBCO products
                    can be accessed most efficiently in row-major order (one complete row at a time).
                    The G93 format can be accessed most efficiently one complete tile at a time.
                    So performance statistics for those two patterns are included in the table
                    below.  Because the NetCDF version of GEBCO_2019 is stored in a semi-compressed
                    format, the timing values for the compressed version of G93 are
                    more relevant than the uncompressed version. Finally, to clarify the
                    differences in behavior between the two API&#39;s, the table repeats the
                    G93 timing data for row-major access.</p>

                <p>The differences in timing reflect the differences in the intention of the
                    two packages. NetCDF is a widely used standard for distributing data
                    (it also has support for a number of languages besides Java, including C/C++, C#, and Python).
                    G93 is intended more for back-end processing for large raster data sets
                    in cases where the pattern-of-access is arbitrary or unpredictable. When using NetCDF
                    (at least the Java version), it is often helpful if the pattern of data access
                    sticks to the underlying organization of the file. For example, when accessing
                    the NetCDF file in column-major order, the ETOPO1 read operation took
                    1184.3 seconds to complete while G93 took 3.3 seconds.  Of course, we
                    need to be a little candid here.  It is possible to devise access patterns that
                    defeat both file formts. Had we accessed the G93 and NetCDF files in a completely random
                    pattern for a very large number of data points, we could have achieved equally
                    bad performance for both.</p>
                <h2 id="memory-mapped-file-access">Why G93 Does not use Memory Mapped File Access</h2>
                <p>The G93 API does not use Java&#39;s memory-mapped file access. Instead, it
                    uses old-school file read-and-write operations. The reason for this
                    is based on known problems in Java. First, Java does not support
                    memory-mapped file access for files larger than 2.1 gigabytes,
                    and raster files of that size or larger are common in scientific
                    applications. Additionally, there are reports that Java does not
                    always close memory mapped files and clean up resources when
                    running under Windows. Thus, for the initial implementation,
                    we decided to avoid memory mapped files.</p>
                <h1 id="data-compression">Data Compression</h1>
                <p>Although there are many good general-purpose data compression utilities
                    available to the software community, raster-based data files tend to
                    compress only moderately well. For example, consider the compression results for
                    ETOPO1 using two well-known compression formats, Zip and 7z.  Since the elevation
                    values in ETOPO1 range from -10803 to 8333, they can be stored comfortably in
                    a two-byte short integer. There are just over 233 million sample points in ETOPO1.
                    Storing them as short integers leads to a storage size of 466,560,000 bytes.
                    Using Zip and 7z compressors on that data yields the following results.</p>

                <p>It is also worth nothing that general-purpose compression has the disadvantage
                    that in order to access any of the data in the file, it is necessary to decompress the whole
                    thing. For many grid-based applications, only a small portion of a raster file is needed
                    at any particular time.</p>
                <p>The G93 API uses standard compression techniques (Huffman coding, Deflate),
                    but transforms the data so that it is more readily compressed and yields
                    better compression ratios. Each tile is compressed individually, so
                    an application that wants only part of the data in the file can
                    obtain it without decompressing everything else. </p>
                <p>The G93 file format supports 3 different data formats:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Integer (4-byte integers)</li>
                    <li>Float (4-byte, 32-bit IEEE-754 standard floating-point values)</li>
                    <li>Integer-coded Float (floating-point values scaled and stored as integers)</li>
                </ol>


                <p>The GEBCO data is expressed in a non-integral form. While the data can be stored
                    as integer-coded-floats, the integer coding requires some loss of precision.
                    So, to store the data in a lossless form, it needs to be represented using
                    the 4-byte floating-point format.  While the floating-point representation of the
                    data preserves all the precision in the original, it requires a different approach
                    to data compression than the integer forms.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, the G93 floating-point implementation does not achieve quite
                    as favorable compression ratios as the integer-based compressors. Floating-point
                    numbers simply do not present the kind of redundancy in their form that facilitates
                    data compression. On the other hand, G93's lossless floating-point compression
                    is as good as any solution currently to be found.</p>

                <p>The table below shows the relative storage size required for different products
                    and storage options. The entries marked GEBCO x 1, GEBCO x 2, are scaled integer
                    representations of the original sample points. There are two reasons that the scaled versions
                    compress more readily than the floating-point. First, the G93 integer
                    compressors are more powerful than the floating-point compressor. Second,
                    the scaling operation truncates some of the fractional part of the original
                    values and, thus, discards some of the information in the original product.</p>

                <p>ETOPO1 data is stored in the form of integers with a small amount of overhead
                    for metadata and file-management elements. As table above shows, G93 data compression reduces
                    the raw data for ETOPO1 from 16 bits per sample to 4.46 bits per sample.  So the storage
                    required for the data is reduced to about 27.9 % of the original size. </p>
                <p>When deciding whether to use the native floating-point representation of the GEBCO data
                    or the more compact integer-scaled float representation,  the main consideration is
                    how much precision is required for the application that uses it. One can reasonably
                    ask just how much precision the GEBCO data really requires.  For example, a scaling
                    factor of 1 essentially rounds the floating-point values to their nearest integers.
                    In effect, this process reduces the data to depth and elevation given in integer meters.
                    For ocean data with 1/2 kilometer sample spacing, an accuracy of 1 meter may be more than is
                    truly required. Even on land, it is unlikely than many of the points in the data set
                    are accurate to within 1 meter of the actual surface elevation. However, the extra
                    precision in the floating-point format (or that achieved with a larger scaling factor)
                    may help reduce data artifacts due to quantization noise. Also, for purposes of this test, we were
                    interested in how well the algorithm would work across varying degrees of precision in
                    the converted data. So we applied various
                    scaling factors as shown in the results above.</p>
                <h1 id="future-work">Future Work</h1>
                <p>When data compression is applied to a G93 file, it adds a considerable amount
                    of processing overhead to the data-writing operation. In future work, it may be
                    possible to improve the throughput of write operations by using a multi-threaded
                    implementation to handle data compression. Although the current implementation of the G93 API is limited
                    to a single thread, the structure of its internal data cache could be adapted to
                    support multiple threads without major revision. A multi-threaded implementation
                    may be considered for future investigations.</p>
                <p>One item that was not fully explored in this article is the effect of disk speed in read
                    operations. The testing was, after all, conducted using a system equiped with
                    a fast solid-state drive. A future investigation will use an USB external disk drive to
                    see how much extra access time a slower disk requires.</p>
                <p>Some of the test results above suggest that there may still be opportunities
                    to improve the access speeds, especially for the block-based file access routines.
                    Future work will involve a careful review of the code used for the readBlock()
                    method.</p>
                <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
                <p>The figures cited in this article provide a rough guide to estimating
                    the kind of performance an application designer can expect using the
                    G93 API. It also gives an indication of the resources that would be needed
                    to process and store data in G93 format.</p>
                <p>As with any API, the design of G93 makes assumptions about the way it will
                    be accessed. Our hope is that those assumptions are broad enough that
                    G93 will provide acceptable performance for most applications.</p>
