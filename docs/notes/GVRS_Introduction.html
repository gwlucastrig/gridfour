                    GVRS: A Fast, File-Based API for Managing Raster Data
                </p>



                <h1>Introduction</h1>

                <p>The Gridfour Virtual Raster System (GVRS) is a file-backed API that
                    helps Java applications manage raster (grid) data in situations
                    where the size of the data exceeds what could reasonably be kept in memory.  To do so,
                    it provides utilities that allow an application to seamlessly swap blocks of the grid
                    between memory and data files. The GVRS library and file format also provide a way of
                    storing raster data in files that can be shared between applications or used
                    across multiple application runs. And, in cases where storage space or
                    transmission bandwidth is limited, GVRS provides built-in data compression
                    that can reduce storage requirements by at least a factor of four.</p>

                <p>This article gives an introduction to the Java API for GVRS and offers
                    example code showing how to use it in your own applications.  As usual,
                    code for the applications described in this article is available from the
                    <a href="https://github.com/gwlucastrig/gridfour">Gridfour Software Project</a>.
                    You may find the code in the Gridfour demo code tree in the class PackageData.java</p>

                <h2>Sample Data</h2>
                <p>An article that describes how to use an API to manipulate and store data
                    would surely benefit from have a good source of data to use as an example.
                    We are fortunate to have two: ETOPO1 and GEBCO_2019. These products
                    give world-wide Earth surface elevations and ocean depth (bathymetry) values
                    in a regular geographic coordinate grid.</p>

                <p>In the ETOPO1 product, grid points
                    are given in a regular spacing of 1 minute of arc (e.g. 60 rows or columns for
                    each degree of latitude or longitude). Thus ETOPO1 includes
                    (360x60)x(180x60) data values, or about 233 million samples. Storing that
                    many numeric values in memory requires a lot of capacity, but is not
                    out-of-reach for a modern computer. The GEBCO product, however, uses a finer
                    resolution based on a grid spacing of 15 seconds of arc (e.g. 240 rows or
                    columns for each degree of latitude or longitude).  That spacing results in
                    a data collection containing 3.7 billion samples.  And while there are plenty
                    of computers with sufficient memory to hold that much data, it wouldn't leave
                    much room for anything else.</p>

                <h2>A Tiling Scheme</h2>
                <p>Fortunately, when dealing with such large data sets, applications seldom
                    need to access the entire collection all at once. So an obvious solution
                    to the problem of memory use is to store the data on a file and load
                    (or store) pieces of it on an as-needed basis. This approach is
                    used in data formats such as the TIFF image specification which
                    partition large grids into smaller, regularly sized sub-grids
                    known as tiles (Adobe, 1992, pg. 68).</p>

                <p>The basic idea of tiling a grid can be seen in the image below. In this case,
                    a grid consisting of six rows and nine columns is divided into six 3-by-3 tiles.</p>


                <figure>
                    <img src="images/General/TilingScheme.png">
                    <figcaption>Figure 1 &ndash; A tiling scheme divides a master grid into uniformly sized sub-gribs.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>In GVRS, the size of tiles are arbitrary, though all tiles must be of
                    a uniform size. Applications are free to specify tile sizes according
                    to their needs. In this case,
                    a 2-by-9 tile would have worked just fine. In fact, a 4-by-5 tile size would
                    also work, even though the tiles would not evenly divide
                    the 6-by-9 master grid. The GVRS API handles any extra cells
                    internally and their management is transparent to the application.</p>

                <p>The figure below illustrates how a tiling scheme works.  A collection of surface
                    elevation and bathymetry data could be divided into regular
                    tiles ten-degrees across. An application requiring access to
                    information in Europe would load the relevant tiles without needing
                    to access information from South America.</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="images/PackingData/TileScheme.png">
                    <figcaption>Figure 2 &ndash; A global data set divided into 10-degree tiles.</figcaption>
                </figure>


                <p>In the case of the ETOPO1 data set, the PackageData
                    demonstration application specifies a grid of 90 rows by 120 columns.
                    In terms of geographic coordinates, the 1-minute resolution
                    used in ETOPO1 means that these tiles will cover an area with a span of
                    1.5 degrees latitude and 2 degrees of longitude.
                    This size was chosen after some experimentation because it gives a
                    good data compression results and provides a convenient size
                    for access.</p>

                <p>Tiling is a core feature of the GVRS API and deeply involved
                    in all its operations.  In fact, even a small grid is treated
                    as being tiled, though it is completely reasonable to specify
                    a tile size that matches that of the entire grid.</p>

                <p>A few other details about GVRS tiling are worth noting:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Tiles can be written or read in any order.</li>
                    <li>Not all tiles in the specification need to be populated with
                        data. The overhead for empty tiles is small.</li>
                    <li>The GVRS compression logic treats each tile as a separate
                        block of data that is compressed individually, without
                        reference to other tiles.</li>
                    <li>A key feature of the GVRS file API is that it maintains an
                        in-memory cache to store tiles for rapid access.</li>
                </ol>


                <h2>Creating a GVRS File</h2>
                <p>The GVRS library is a tool for both creating raster files and accessing them.
                    Writing a GVRS file is a 3 step process:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>A specification is created giving the grid and tile size parameters.
                        Other metadata may be specified as needed.</li>
                    <li>The grid specification and a file-path specification are used to
                        create a new file for writing data. The initial file is treated as
                        an empty collection of tiles and will typically be smaller than 1 kilobyte
                        in size.</li>
                    <li>Values are added to the file one grid-point at a time. The internal
                        bookkeeping and management of tiles is mostly transparent to the
                        calling application.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The code fragment below is taken from the PackageData example
                    application (with some simplifications applied for the sake of
                    this discussion).   PackageData extracts elevation and bathymetry
                    values from the ETOPO1 and GEBCO products, and stores the information
                    in a GVRS file with optional data compression.  Both ETOPO1 and GEBCO
                    are distributed in a file format called NetCDF. We have posted an
                    article that provides background information on NetCDF files as well
                    as details for reading their content at
                    <a href="https://gwlucastrig.github.io/gridfour/notes/How-to-Extract-Data-from-a-NetCDF-File">
                        How-to-Extract-Data-from-a-NetCDF-File</a>.</p>

                <p>The parameters for the number of rows and columns in the grid are based on the
                    dimensions of the source data.  The number of rows and columns in the
                    tile were chosen because they seemed well suited to the needs of an application
                    that might use the GVRS file.</p>

                <pre>
	NetcdfFile ncfile = NetcdfFile.open(filePathToSourceETOPO1);
	Variable z = ncfile.findVariable("z");  // the NetCDF variable for reading values

	int nRowsInGrid = 10800;  // spans 90 south to 90 north
	int nColsInGrid = 21600;  // spans 180 west to 180 east
	int nRowsInTile = 90;
	int nColsInTile = 120;

	// Create a specification for the overall grid and tiling.
	GvrsFileSpecification spec
            = new GvrsFileSpecification(nRowsInGrid, nColsInGrid, nRowsInTile, nColsInTile);


	// Create a GVRS-formatted file for output
	File outputFile = new File("ETOPO1.gvrs");
	GvrsFile gvrsFile = new GvrsFile(outputFile, spec);
                </pre>

                <p>When a GVRS file is created, the metadata from the specification object is used to populate
                    the header file.  Some of this metadata is immutable and must be fully specified before
                    the output file is created, other elements can be adjusted after the file is opened.
                    We will look at some of these setting later on.</p>

                <h2>Storing Data</h2>
                <p>As shown in the code block below, storing data in a GVRS file is a relatively straightforward process.
                    In fact, most of complexity in the code example comes from accessing the NetCDF data
                    rather than writing the GVRS.  The example reads data from the source file one
                    row at a time.  This is the most efficient pattern for accessing the ETOPO1 file.</p>

                <pre>
	// initialize access specifications for NetCDF.
	int[] readOrigin = new int[2];
	int[] readShape = new int[2];

	for (int iRow = 0; iRow < nRowsInGrid; iRow++) {
		readOrigin[0] = iRow;
		readOrigin[1] = 0;
		readShape[0] = 1;
		readShape[1] = nColsInGrid;
		// Read one row of data from the NetCDF file.
		// The data will be stored in a NetCDF "Array" object.
		// Then loop on each column, obtain the elevation/bathymetry data
		// and store it in GVRS.   ETOPO1 stores data as integers.
		// GEBCO_2019 stores it as doubles.
		Array array = z.read(readOrigin, readShape);.
		for (int iCol = 0; iCol < nColsInGrid; iCol++) {
			int sample = array.getInt(iCol);
			gvrs.storeValue(iRow, iCol, sample);
		}
	}
	gvrs.flush();
	gvrs.close();
                </pre>

                <p>The snippet above would work just fine, except that it might be a little
                    slower than we would prefer.  The reason for this is that each row
                    stored to the data file requires swapping tiles in and out of memory.
                    Because there are 21600 columns in the master grid and 120 columns in each tile,
                    there are 21600/120 = 180 tiles in each row of the tiling scheme. So in order
                    to keep an entire row of the master-grid data in memory, the GVRS API
                    needs to keep 180 tiles in its cache. But, by default, the GVRS cache size
                    is only 16 tiles in size.  And 16 tiles is not wide enough to hold an
                    entire row of data. Because the storage process scans
                    one-row-at-a-time, the cache has to drop and load tiles 180 times per
                    row.  This approach leads to a lot of redundant reading and writing of tiles.</p>

                <p>Fortunately, the tile cache size can be adjusted by
                    using the following adjustment before storing the data.</p>

                <pre>
    gvrs.setTileCacheSize(GvrsCacheSize.Large);
                </pre>

                <p>The adjustment is applied after the GvrsFile is opened, but before the
                    application starts to access data. The "Large" cache size adjustment
                    tells GVRS to adjust the size of the
                    cache so that it is large enough to store an entire row (or entire column)
                    of tiles.  Tiles use 4 bytes per each value stored in memory. Because this
                    example code specifies a tile size of 90-by-120 grid values, an entire row
                    of 180 tiles would require 180x90x120x4 = 7776000 bytes (about 7.4 megabytes).
                    This setting is not onerous, and it will dramatically improve the speed
                    of writing a file.</p>

                <p>How much difference does the larger cache make?  With the default "Medium"
                    cache size, the time required to store ETOPO1 in uncompressed format was 237.2 seconds.
                    With the "Large" size setting, it was only 8.6 seconds. The use of a large cache can
					also be useful when reading data. In testing, we compared the access time
					using both a Medium and Large cache size
					for reading the entire 233 million sample set from the GVRS-formatted version of ETOPO1.
					Using the Medium cache, the read operation required 69.8 seconds. Using the Large cache,
					the operation required only 3.6 seconds.</p>

                <p>Here it is worth emphasizing that the need for a larger cache size
                    is due to the pattern-of-access applied in packaging the data.
                    Had the packaging process populated a single tile at a time
                    (rather than spanning an entire row of tiles), the increased tile
                    cache size would not have been required. This consideration applies
                    both when writing data and when reading data for a GVRS file.</p>

                <h1>Other Settings</h1>

                <h2>Run-time Settings</h2>
                <p>By run-time settings, we are referring to those parameters that can be set using
                    access methods for the GvrsFile class after a GvrsFile is opened. These parameters
                    are not part of the file definition and are not stored between sessions.</p>

                <p>We already introduced the tile-cache size and described how it can affect run-time
                    performance. The other setting of interest is</p>

                <pre>
	gvrs.setIndexCreationEnabled(boolean enabled);
                </pre>

                <p>When writing data to a GVRS file, we have the option of telling GVRS to write
                    an index file when the file is closed. The index file is a companion data file
                    written with the sample root name as the GVRS file and the file extension ".g9x".
                    The index carries information about the location of tiles within the
                    GVRS file.  Without the index, the GvrsFile class has to perform a scan of
                    the full file at start-up. Since GVRS files can be quite large, such
                    scans can take a few seconds (more on slow file systems).  The availablity of
                    an index expedites that process considerably. Again, the index file is optional.
                    If it was accidentally deleted, the GVRS API would be able to open
                    the main file just fine.</p>

                <h2>Specification Settings</h2>
                <p>In addition to the overall grid size and tiling scheme specifications,
                    there are a number of other settings that can be stored in a GVRS file header
                    when it is created.  These settings are supplied through calls to the
                    GvrsFileSpecification class' access methods.</p>

                <h3>Coordinate System</h3>
                <p>The main GvrsFile API allows an application to read and write raster data
                    values by supplying the row and column indices for the values of interest.
                    Many real-world applications depend on a horizontal coordinate system
                    that relate these values not to grid coordinates, but real-valued
                    position information.</p>

                <p>Gridfour allows an application to specify two broad categories of coordinate
                    systems for file access: <i>Cartesian Coordinates</i> and <i>Geographic Coordinates</i>.</p>

                <p>Although Gridfour is not limited to geographic coordinate systems,
                    the two example products we used for this wiki-article are geographic in nature.
                    So we will begin with the specification for a geographic coordinate
                    system.</p>

                <p>As mentioned above, the row and column spacing for ETOPO1 is a uniform 1 minute of
                    arc (1/60th of a degree). There are a couple of ETOPO1 variations. The
                    one chosen for this discussion runs from south to north and west to east.
                    The latitudes start just above the South Pole and run to just below the North.
                    The longitudes start just to the east of the International Date Line (-179.99166
                    longitude) and extend to just to its west (+179.99166 longitude).
                    The following code snippet shows an example of how a specification for ETOPO1
                    geographic coordinates could be constructed:</p>

                <pre>
    GvrsFileSpecification spec
            = new GvrsFileSpecification(nRows, nCols, nRowsInTile, nColsInTile);
	double h = 1.0/60.0;  // one minute spacing, 1/60th of a degree
    spec.setGeographicCoordinates(
             -90+h/2,   // south, first row in grid
            -180+h/2,   // west, first column in grid
              90-h/2,   // north, last row in grid
             180-h/2);  // east, last column in grid
                </pre>

                <p>Note that the geographic coordinates are given in degrees and specified
                    in the order latitude, longitude.  West longitudes are given as negative
                    values. East longitudes are given as positive values.</p>

                <p>As an example of Cartesian coordinates, consider an example in which the
                    (x, y) coordinates are normalized between 0 and 1.  In that case, we might specify
                    coordinates using the following</p>

                <pre>
    GvrsFileSpecification spec
            = new GvrsFileSpecification(nRows, nCols, nRowsInTile, nColsInTile);
    spec.setCartesianCoordinates(
            0,   // x coordinate of first column in grid
            0,   // y coordinate of first row in grid
            1,   // x coordinate of last column in grid
            1);  // y coordinate of last row in grid
                </pre>

                <p>The order of the Cartesian coordinates follows the standard practice
                    of being given as (x, y).  In the example above, we assumed that the coordinates
                    were increasing as the row and column index increased.  Consider the case where
                    the x coordinate increased which the y coordinate decreased. Such a specification
                    would look like:</p>

                <pre>
     spec.setCartesianCoordinates(
            0,   // x coordinate of first column in grid
            1,   // y coordinate of first row in grid
            1,   // x coordinate of last column in grid
            0);  // y coordinate of last row in grid
                </pre>

                <p>The GvrsFile class implements methods for mapping Cartesian or Geographic coordinates
                    to grid coordinates and vice versus.  These are shown below:</p>

                <pre>
	public double []mapGridToCartesian(double row, double column)   // returns x,y
	public double []mapCartesianToGrid(double   x, double      y)

	public double []mapGridToGeographic(double row, double column)  // returns lat, lon
	public double []mapGeographicToGrid(double latitude, longitude)
                </pre>

                <p>Note that the mapping functions may return and/or accept fractional values for the row
                    and column values the process. This feature is intended to support data value interpolation.</p>

                <h2>Data definition: dimension and data type.</h2>
                <p>GvrsFiles can process either scalar values or vector values. For example, surface elevation
                    is a scalar value. But ocean currents or surface winds have both direction and magnitude
                    and are usually treated as vectors.  For GVRS, scalar values are said to be of dimension 1.
                    A vector such as Earth surface wind data would be of dimension 2.  Higher dimension data is
                    also supported.</p>

                <p>GvrsFiles also allow the specification of integer data or floating point values.</p>

                <p>The data type and dimension are specified using one of the following calls:</p>

                <pre>
	spec.setDataModelInt(  int dimension);
	spec.setDataModelFloat(int dimension);
	spec.setDataModelIntegerScaledFloat(int dimension,  double scale,  double offset);
                </pre>

                <p>The scale and offset values specified as part of the integer-scaled-float model are used
                    in cases where floating point values are to be converted to integers for internal storage.
                    While this approach can result in reduced precision for the input data, it has advantages
                    when compressing the data. The GVRS implementations of integer compression attain
                    better compression ratios than the implementation for floating-point values.
                    If data compression is not required, the integer-scaled option has little advantage.
                    However, it is worth noting that this format is sometimes encountered in raster data
                    formats used for publicly available data sources and the GVRS equivalent may be useful
                    in handling such source.</p>

                <p>Scale and offset are treated as follows:</p>

                <pre>
	intValue = (floatValue-offset) * scale
	floatValue = (intValue/scale) + offset
                </pre>

                <h2>Data Compression</h2>
                <p>Data compression is enabled as part of the file specification:</p>

                <pre>
    spec.setDataCompressionEnabled(compressionEnabled);
                </pre>

                <p>Data compression is an interesting topic and is discussed in more
                    detail elsewhere in these notes (see
                    <a href="https://gwlucastrig.github.io/gridfour/notes/GridfourDataCompressionAlgorithms.html">Gridfour Raster Data Compression Algorithms</a>
                    and
                    <a href="https://gwlucastrig.github.io/gridfour/notes/LosslessCompressionForFloatingPointData.html">Lossless Compression for Floating Point Data</a>).
                    Here, we simply note it's impact
                    on the storage for ETOPO1 and GEBCO_2019 data.  In its native, uncompressed form,
                    ETOPO1 data is stored as a 4-byte integer. GEBCO_2019 is stored as
                    a 4-byte float. Both of these would require 32 bits per sample if they
                    were stored without data compression. The Gridfour library provides lossless data compression for both
                    integer and float formats. Because integer forms tend to compress better than
                    floating-point data, GEBCO data compresses better if it is converted to an
                    integer form.  In the table below, data for GEBCO is given for both
                    its native floating point format and as scaled integer.
                    GEBCO x 1 is rounded to the nearest meter, GEBCO x 2 to the nearest half meter.
                    The larger scaling factor increases the amount of information to be stored
                    in the output file, and thus the bits-per-sample values increases.</p>

                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Product</th>

                    </tr>
                </table>

                <p>Earlier, we mentioned that the storage time for the uncompressed version of ETOPO1
                    was 8.6 seconds. As the values in the table show, compressing the data requires more
                    processing and increases the time to process to 68.3 seconds. However, most data compression
                    techniques in use today require far less processing to decompress data than to compress it.
                    This generalization is also true for all the currently implemented Gridfour data compression utilities.
					While it took over a minute to compress the ETOPO1 data, the time required to read
					the entire 233 million points in the compressed data set was only 6.3 seconds.</p>

                <p>Even though the integer-coded GEBCO x 1 and the ETOPO1 products represent elevations with the
                    same precision (as integral meters), the bits per-sample-value for GEBCO x 1
                    is lower than that for ETOPO1. This difference occurs because
                    the sample points in the GEBCO grid are spaced closer together than those for ETOPO1
                    (15 seconds of arc versus 1 minute of arc). With the closer spacing, there
                    tends to be less variation from sample to sample, which leads to an improved
                    predictability in the data. With improved predictability, better data compression
                    ratios can be attained</p>


                <h2>Adding Supplemental Content with Variable-Length Records</h2>
                <p>In order to maintain a simple design, the GVRS API presents a deliberately
                    minimal feature set. Even so, we recognize that many users have application-specific
                    requirements for the product. In some cases, users may wish to attach supplemental
                    data to a GVRS file. This requirement can be met through the use of the
                    Variable-Length Record feature.</p>

                <p>Variable-Length Records (VLRs) are blocks of text or binary data that can be
                    stored as part of a GVRS file. The GVRS API treats these elements as <i>opaque</i> and
                    does not perform any operation related to their content. These elements may be
                    stored or retrieved using identification tags provided by the application.</p>

                <p>The ETOPO1 and GEBCO products provide an example of how this feature may be used.
                    Both data sets are based on geophysical information and, naturally, there are
                    industry standards for specifying metadata related to their content.
                    Because GVRS is intended to be a general-purpose utility,
                    adding direct support for such standards is outside its scope. However, the PackageData
                    demonstration application implements code for storing relevant metadata in a
                    GVRS file.</p>

                <p>The metadata bundled with the demonstration code is based on the <i>Well-Known Text (WKT)</i> standard
                    which is supported by many Geographic Information Systems. Well-Known Text files provide
                    information about coordinate systems (map projections), units of measure, and
                    specifications for Earth's size and shape ("datums"), and other information
                    needed to accurately represent the data on a map. While neither ETOPO1 nor GEBCO
                    supply WKT files in their distributions, both include relevant specifications on
                    their product web sites. For the demo, we used the information to create a
                    file called GlobalMSL.prj that contains metadata in WKT format.</p>

                <p>Variable-Length Records are stored using a call to the GvrsFile class' storeVariableLengthRecord()
                    method as shown in the following code snippet:</p>

                <pre>
    byte []b; // an array of bytes containing the WKT data

    gvrs.storeVariableLengthRecord(
            "GVRS_Projection",
            2111,
            "WKT Projection Metadata",
            b, 0, b.length, true);
                </pre>

                <p>The first two arguments in the call provide application-defined identification
                    keys for the variable-length text.  The last argument indicates that the payload (content)
                    for the VLR is a text product. An application wishing to fetch the information
                    from the GVRS file would do so by calling</p>

                <pre>
    VariableLengthRecord vlr = gvrs.getVariableLengthRecord("Gvrs_Projection", 2111);
    String payloadText = vlr.readPayloadText();
                </pre>

                <p>The method that fetches the VLR is named "get" because the record identifications
                    are loaded from a GVRS file when it is initially opened. So the method simply gets
                    the identification from memory. However, the method that fetches the text
                    is named "read" because a file-read operation is needed to retrieve it.</p>

                <p>As mentioned above, the assignment of the identification string and numeric
                    value (in this case, "Gvrs_Projection" and 2111) are arbitrary and are defined
                    by the application. The parameters used for this example are based on the LAS file
                    standard that are used for terrestrial Lidar data sets. For background on Lidar systems,
                    see <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/lidar.html">What is Lidar?</a>
                    at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration web site.
                    The LAS standard defines a data structure called "Variable Length Record"
                    which was the model for the GVRS implementation.  LAS uses the identifications
                    LASF_Projection, 2111 for Well-Known Text.</p>

                <p>At present, there is no registry or official standard for specifying
                    identification strings in GVRS. The development of such a resource would
                    depend on much wider adoption of GVRS than is currently the case.</p>

                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <p>The information given in this wiki article should be enough to get you
                    started using GVRS.  The use of many of the functions described above
                    is demonstrated in the <a href="https://github.com/gwlucastrig/gridfour/blob/master/demo/src/main/java/org/gridfour/demo/globalDEM/PackageData.java">PackageData.java</a>
                    application included in the Gridfour software distribution.</p>

                <p>The GVRS API is still under development. While it has undergone quite a bit of testing, it has seen
                    very little actual use. If you encounter issues using GVRS, please let us know.
                    Also, if you identify new features or enhancements you would like added to the API,
                    we welcome your suggestions.</p>
