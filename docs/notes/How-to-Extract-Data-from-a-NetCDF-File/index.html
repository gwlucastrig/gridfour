                    How to Extract Data from a NetCDF File
                </p>




                <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
                <p>Many important and useful public sources of geophysical data are distributed in the
                    <em>Network Common Data Format</em> or NetCDF. NetCDF is a well supported and flexible
                    standard that can be adapted to a wide range of data products including both
                    vector and raster (grid) data types. Examples of the use of NetCDF for raster data
                    include digital elevation models, satellite imagery, and even ocean currents.
                    But NetCDF's flexibility brings a level of complexity that sometimes makes
                    it hard to get started with the NetCDF software libaries. On first inspection
                    of the API, it is not always clear how to extract data from a NetCDF file.</p>
                <p>This article will attempt to assist software developers using NetCDF by presenting
                    an example implementation of a Java application that uses the NetCDF to
                    access two geophysical data products: ETOPO1 and GEBCO_2019. Both these
                    products provide global-scale collections of elevation and ocean-depth (bathymetry)
                    information.  ETOPO1 features over 233 million data points arranged in a geographic
                    coordinate system (a latitude/longitude grid) at regular intervals of 1 minute of arc
                    (equivalent to about 1.85 kilometers at the equator). GEBCO_2019 features more than
                    3.7 billion data points arranged with a grid spacing of 15 seconds of arc
                    (equivalent to about 0.46 kilometers).</p>
                <p>The figure below illustrates the difference in resolution for the two data sets.</p>
                <figure>

                </figure>

                <p>The full source code for the Java application described in this article
                    is available as part of the &quot;demo&quot; module at  <a href="https://github.com/gwlucastrig/gridfour">The Gridfour Software Project</a>.
                    in the class <a href="https://github.com/gwlucastrig/gridfour/blob/master/demo/src/main/java/org/gridfour/demo/globalDEM/ExtractData.java">ExtractData.java</a>.
                    Some of the code snippets shown below have been modified for use in this article. The examples will help to clarify
                    how to read NetCDF files in Java.</p>
                <h1 id="accessing-a-netcdf-file">Accessing a NetCDF file</h1>
                <p>Let's get started.  Opening a NetCDF file using the Java API is easy. The code block below shows how:</p>

                <pre>
    // inputPath is a Java string giving the path to a file such as
    //    1.   ETOPO1_Ice_c_gmt4.grd
    //    2.   GEBCO_2019.nc
    NetcdfFile ncfile = NetcdfFile.open(inputPath);
                </pre>





                <p>Most NetCDF files end in the file-extension &quot;.nc&quot;. The ETOPO1 file is somewhat
                    unusual in that it is specified with the extension &quot;.grd&quot;.</p>
                <p>Just like any other file-access API in Java, the NetCDF file functions can throw
                    I/O exceptions.  Fortunately, the NetCDF authors avoided the temptation to implement
                    custom exceptions (with a few exceptions), so exception-handling code for NetCDF
                    is largely the same as for any Java file-based API. For simplicity, the code snippets
                    in this article omit the exception-handling elements.</p>
                <h2 id="reading-the-data">Reading the Data</h2>
                <p>Having opened the file, it's time for the ExtractData application to extract content.
                    The primary mechanism for accessing information in a NetCDF file is through the use
                    of a Java class named <em>Variable</em>.  The example below obtains a list of all the
                    Variable instances stored in the NetCDF file and prints it using a Java PrintStream
                    named &quot;ps&quot;.  In this example, we initialize ps to System.out, but it could also be
                    repurposed to write to a text file if we wanted a more permanent record of the extracted
                    data. When printing to standard output, I have one caveat... The 5.1 version of
                    the NetCDF Java API had a bug in which it would close standard output when processing
                    the GEBCO data (but not the ETOPO1). Therefore I recommend that you use
                    more recent (or earlier) versions of the library. </p>
                <pre>
    PrintStream ps = System.out;
    NetcdfFile ncfile = NetcdfFile.open(inputPath);

    ps.println("Variables found in file:");
    List&lt;Variable&gt; variables = ncfile.getVariables();
    for (Variable v : variables) {
       ps.println("\n" + v.toString());
    }
                </pre>

                <p>Like conventional variables, NetCDF Variable objects are identified by name.
                    And each Variable may be associated with an underlying standard data type (integer, short, float, etc.).
                    Variables may store either a single value, an array of values, a grid of values,
                    and so forth. Part of the flexibility of a NetCDF file is its ability to store multiple data sets
                    within a single file all with different names, data types, and raster definitions.
                    Each data set is associated with one or more Variables.</p>
                <p>The Java NetCDF Variable class implements quite a good toString() method.  The text below shows
                    the output from the ETOPO1 data file ETOPO1_Ice_c_gmt4.grd.  Both the ETOPO1 and GEBCO products contain
                    only three Variables. It is, however, common for NetCDF files to contain dozens of variables (often
                    including several different kinds of content).</p>

                <pre>
    Variables found in file:

    double x(x=21600);
      :long_name = "Longitude";
      :actual_range = -180.0, 180.0; // double
      :units = "degrees_east";

    double y(y=10800);
      :long_name = "Latitude";
      :actual_range = -89.99999999999997, 90.0; // double
      :units = "degrees_north";

    int z(y=10800, x=21600);
      :long_name = "z";
      :_FillValue = -2147483648; // int
      :actual_range = -10803.0, 8333.0; // double
                </pre>


                <p>The angular spacing for the coordinate grid used by ETOPO1 is 1 minute of arc.  There are
                    60 minutes in one degree. So a grid with a 360-degree range of coverage would include
                    360x60 = 21600 columns. And 21600 is, in fact, the order of the Variable x.
                    The interpretation of the Variable y is a bit more complicated because it
                    doesn't start and end at the poles (+/- 90 degrees latitude), but the arithmetic is similar.</p>
                <p>One thing worth noting here is that the authors of ETOPO1 chose to include Variables defining the
                    geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) associated with each row  and column in the grid.
                    They could have just as easily included variables giving the overall range of the coordinates
                    or a uniform cell-spacing specification. However, a lot of products currently being
                    produced in NetCDF format seem to prefer the convention used by ETOPO1. This approach
                    increases the size of the specifications by a small proportion. But it has the advantage
                    of flexibility, because it allows for non-uniform coordinate specifications (i.e. rows that
                    are not equally spaced, columns that are not equally spaced, etc.).</p>
                <p>Before we look into how to extract numeric (or text) values from a NetCDF Variable,
                    let's take a look at the output that would result if we used the same code
                    as shown above on the GEBCO_2019.nc file.  </p>


                <pre>

    double lon(lon=86400);
      :standard_name = "longitude";
      :long_name = "longitude";
      :units = "degrees_east";
      :axis = "X";
      :sdn_parameter_urn = "SDN:P01::ALONZZ01";
      :sdn_parameter_name = "Longitude east";
      :sdn_uom_urn = "SDN:P06::DEGE";
      :sdn_uom_name = "Degrees east";

    double lat(lat=43200);
      :standard_name = "latitude";
      :long_name = "latitude";
      :units = "degrees_north";
      :axis = "Y";
      :sdn_parameter_urn = "SDN:P01::ALATZZ01";
      :sdn_parameter_name = "Latitude north";
      :sdn_uom_urn = "SDN:P06::DEGN";
      :sdn_uom_name = "Degrees north";

    float elevation(lat=43200, lon=86400);
      :long_name = "Elevation relative to sea level";
      :units = "m";
      :sdn_parameter_urn = "SDN:P01::ALATZZ01";
      :sdn_parameter_name = "Sea floor height (above mean sea level) {bathymetric height}";
      :sdn_uom_urn = "SDN:P06::ULAA";
      :sdn_uom_name = "Metres";
      :standard_name = "height_above_reference_ellipsoid";
      :_ChunkSizes = 1U, 86400U; // uint
                </pre>


                <p>As you can see, the GEBCO product uses different variable names than
                    ETOPO1. The choice of variable names is a matter of convention and taste. In the GEBCO product,
                    the dimensions of the lon and lat Variables are four times that of the corresponding
                    x and y Variables used in ETOPO1.  These parameters reflect the factor
                    of four difference in resolution (15 seconds of arc for GEBCO versus the
                    60 minutes of arc used for ETOPO1). The GEBCO product also includes
                    a few more descriptive data items than the ETOPO1 product had (including
                    units-of-measure, sdn_parameter_name, etc.).  The NetCDF Java API uses the term &quot;attribute&quot;
                    to describe these items. The role of NetCDF attributes used in relation to
                    Variables is similar to the role of attributes in XML specifications.  Just as an
                    XML attribute provides supplemental or descriptive data for the XML element that includes it,
                    a NetCDF attribute provides supplemental or descriptive data for the Variable to which
                    it belongs.</p>
                <h2 id="extracting-the-grid-data-from-the-raster-variable">Extracting the Grid Data from the Raster Variable</h2>
                <p>For the ExtractData demonstration application, I wanted to produce a result
                    that would indicate whether the data had been extracted correctly. And it seemed
                    like an output image would be a good indicator of success. So the ExtractDemo
                    application uses the elevation and bathymetry data from the NetCDF source files
                    to create a 720 pixel wide by 360 pixel high image.  Each pixel in the image is
                    the average of some number of depth/elevation values from the source files
                    (30x30 = 900 values per pixel for ETOPO1, 120x120=14400 values per pixel for GEBCO).</p>
                <p>The rasters in both these products are given in row-major order. In other words,
                    when we extract data, we can use two nested loops.  The outer loop loops on row,
                    the inner on column. </p>
                <p>How do we know that the data is in row-major order?  One clue is to look at
                    the first line for the toString() output from the &quot;z&quot; and &quot;elevation&quot; variables:</p>


                <pre>
    int z(y=10800, x=21600)
    float elevation(lat=43200, lon=86400)
                </pre>



                <p>In both cases, the row-related variable (y or lat) is listed first
                    followed by the column-related variable (x or lon). This fact suggests that
                    the secondary argument (the column element) varies more quickly than the
                    primary argument (row). That, in turn, suggests the order in which we can access the data
                    most efficiently.</p>
                <p>Of course, to read the content of those variables in code, we need to
                    invoke one of the access methods in the NetCDF API to obtain the Variables
                    of interest. Upon inspecting the output from the Variable toString() methods
                    shown above, we know the names of the Variables associated with the raster (grid).
                    Extracting them from the NetCDF file is just a matter of implementing a
                    if/then statement based on which product we are processing:</p>
                <pre>
    Variable z; // the variable that ExtractData uses for elevation and bathymetry
    if (product.startsWith("ETOP")) {
      z = ncfile.findVariable("z");
    } else {
      // the product is GEBCO
      z = ncfile.findVariable("elevation");
    }
                </pre>

                <p>Next, we need to obtain the dimensions of the grid stored in the
                    raster Variable from the NetCDF file:</p>
                <pre>
    int rank = z.getRank();
    int[] shape = z.getShape();  // will be an array int[rank].

    int nRows = shape[0];
    int nCols = shape[1];
    ps.format("Rows:      %8d%n", nRows);
    ps.format("Columns:   %8d%n", nCols);
                </pre>


                <p>The <em>rank</em> of a NetCDF variable is essentially the dimensions of the Variable.
                    A grid has rows and columns, so the z/elevation Variables have a rank of 2.
                    The latitude and longitude related variables both have rank of 1.  The <em>shape</em>
                    array allows NetCDF to pass back information about the size of each
                    set of elements contained in the Variable.</p>
                <p>The NetCDF API allows an application to access a Variable's content in any order
                    that it requires. However, just like any other file-based data format, the most
                    efficient access follows the sequence on which the data is organized in the
                    file. Because the data is in row-major order, we access it one row at a time.
                    This is not always the most optimal pattern for access, and sometimes when
                    reading a NetCDF file, an application needs to be aware of a feature called
                    a &quot;chunk size&quot;.  We'll discuss more about that later on. For now, we can access
                    the data using logic in the form shown below.  </p>
                <p>In the logic that follows, the application code tells NetCDF the size of the
                    block of data it wishes to retrieve by using two arrays sized to the
                    rank of the data set. The readOrigin array tells NetCDF where the application
                    wishes to start reading data. The readShape tells NetCDF the dimensions of
                    the block of data the application wishes to retrieve. The return from
                    a Variable's &quot;read&quot; operation is a NetCDF Array.   The array is a one-dimensional
                    array of readShape[0]*readShape[1] elements, given in row-major order.</p>
                <pre>
    // define two integer arrays
    int[] readOrigin = new int[rank];
    int[] readShape = new int[rank];
    for (int iRow = 0; iRow < nRows; iRow++) {
       // set up to read the entire row, but just one row.
       readOrigin[0] = iRow;  // rows are numbered from zero
       readOrigin[1] = 0;     // columns are numbered from zero
       readShape[0]  = 1;     // read one row
       readShape[1]  = nCols; // read the entire set of columns for that row

       Array array = z.read(readOrigin, readShape);
       for (int iCol = 0; iCol < nCols; iCol++) {
          double sample = array.getDouble(iCol);
          // transfer sample to the collection of data for the picture.
       }
    }

    ncfile.close();   // always a good idea.
                </pre>
                <p>The example above omits the logic for transcribing the input data to the
                    image, but you can find it in the source code for
                    <a href="https://github.com/gwlucastrig/gridfour/blob/master/demo/src/main/java/org/gridfour/demo/globalDEM/ExtractData.java">ExtractData.java</a>
                    which is posted on the Gridfour Software Project page.  The results are shown below.</p>
                <p>For the first figure, I used NOAA's <a href="http://ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/global.html">ETOPO1 Global Relief Model palette</a>
                    to assign colors the data based on elevation or depth.</p>

                <p>The ExtractData application includes logic for creating shaded-relief images.  The surface normal is
                    computed from the source data using Gridfour's B-Spline interpolation class.  Shading is added using
                    a simple lighting model.  To emphasize the structure of the data, I used a lighter palette that
                    favored ocean colors. A detailed dicussion of shaded-relief algorithms is
                    included in the article <a href="https://gwlucastrig.github.io/gridfour/notes/ElevationGeoTiff1.html">
                        Elevation Data from Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs Part I: Shaded-Relief Techniques</a>.</p>

                <h2 id="the-chunk-size">The Chunk Size</h2>
                <p>If you look at the output from the toString() method for the elevation Variable
                    used for GEBCO 2019, you see that it includes an attribute called &quot;chunk size&quot;.</p>
                <pre>
    float elevation(lat=43200, lon=86400);
    :_ChunkSizes = 1U, 86400U; // uint
                </pre>

                <p>The chunk size is an optional parameter that allows applications to organize the
                    layout of data on disk.  The default layout for grid products is in a row-major
                    form, and if the chunk size is omitted (as it was in the ETOPO1 product), that
                    is what will be used. The design for applications that perform intensive access
                    to a NetCDF file should pay attention to the chunk size.  A pattern
                    of access that follows the sequence in which data is laid out within a file
                    will usually operate more efficiently than one that does not. </p>
                <p>Fortunately, the data access in the Java API for NetCDF is quite efficient.
                    For moderate data access requirements, the order of access doesn't matter.
                    But for intense operations, it can make a difference.  For example,
                    running ExtractData on ETOPO1 requires only a few seconds of run time.
                    However, as an experiment I modified the ExtractData code to read the NetCDF
                    file one column at a time rather than one row at a time. The operation took
                    over 20 minutes. Of course, that pattern of access was pretty much the worst possible
                    way to access the ETOPO1 product and was equivalent to reading through the entire
                    file several thousand times. So as long as your application pays attention to
                    the design of the data product, it the NetCDF API should provide acceptable performance.</p>
                <h1 id="an-extra">An Extra: How Much Water is in the World's Oceans?</h1>
                <p>Given that we have two excellent global bathymetry products at our disposal,
                    I thought it would be interesting to do something with that data.
                    Did you every wonder how much water is in the world's oceans? Having data
                    collections of, literally, millions of bottom-depth values should
                    allow us to make some estimates.</p>
                <p>Each grid cell in the ETOPO1 and GEBCO_2019 data sets covers a distinct
                    portion of the Earth's surface. The overall area of these cells varies as
                    a function of latitude.  Knowing the row spacing for the various products
                    and applying a bit of elementary calculus allows us to compute these areas.
                    The code for the calculation can be found in the demonstration class
                    <a href="https://github.com/gwlucastrig/gridfour/blob/master/demo/src/main/java/org/gridfour/demo/globalDEM/ExtractionCoordinates.java">ExtractionCoordinates.java</a>
                    which implements a method called getAreaOfEachCellInRow().  As it reads data from
                    the NetCDF files, the ExtractData application looks for sample points that
                    give negative values (indicating elevations below mean sea level).  The technique is not a perfect.
                    There are some land areas such as Death Valley, CA, which lie below sea level and so make
                    a small volume contribution to the calculation. Even so, this approach provides a good high-order estimate.
                    The results are shown below:</p>

                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>

                            <td>361747563 km<sup>2</sup></td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Avg. Depth</td>
                            <td>3435 m</td>
                            <td>3448 m</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <p>The numbers printed by the Gridfour application show more digits of precision that is actually
                    supported by the data.  The extra digits are intended for testing purposes and should be viewed with
                    an appropriate skepticism. The difference in results for the data two products is a consequence
                    of their different grid cell size and data sources.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, NOAA has posted its own results based on the ETOPO1 data set at
                    <a href="https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/etopo1_ocean_volumes.html">NOAA's Volumes of the World's Oceans</a>
                    They cite an estimate for the volume of 1,335,000,000 km<sup>3</sup> which is close to the
                    Gridfour result.  They also offer an error estimate of 1% for that figure. That value which provides a useful insight into
                    how NOAA views the quality of the data. Given the many unknowns in surveying the world's oceans,
                    one percent isn't bad...</p>
                <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
                <p>While this discussion covered the most important features of the NetCDF API,
                    there are a number of additional features available for your use. Furthermore,
                    NetCDF is not limited to raster (grid) based products such as those discussed
                    in this wiki article. It can also support vector products (lines, point features,
                    polygons, etc.).</p>
                <p>Readers who would like to learn more about the NetCDF internals and API may do
                    so by visiting the official <a href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/current/tutorial/index.html">NetCDF Java Tutorial</a>. You can also find additional examples and
                    &quot;insider&quot; information about the  <a href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/">Unidata NetCDF Java</a> page.</p>
                <p>I hope this article will help simplify some of the issues in getting started with the Java NetCDF API.
                    I wish you the best of luck on all of your endeavors.</p>
