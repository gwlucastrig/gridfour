                    Compression Algorithms for Raster Data used in the Gridfour Implementation
                </p>



                <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
                <p>This document provides details on the design, methods, and algorithms used
                    by the Gridfour raster (grid) data compression implementation.</p>
                <p>One of the goals for the Gridfour software is to provide a testbed for developers who are investigating
                    data-compression techniques for grid-based data. To that end, the Gridfour API
                    includes an implementation of a file format named G93 which provides a file-based
                    system for storing gridded data. Gridfour supports compression through the use of
                    custom <em>codec</em> (coder-decoder) classes that are included in its software
                    distribution. These codecs may be used through the G93 file API or in stand-alone mode
                    depending on the requirements of the applications that use them.  Developers may
                    also leverage the Gridfour API to write their own custom codecs.
                    To illustrate how a compression codec could be implemented, Gridfour provides codecs based on the well-known
                    Huffman coding (Huffman, 1952) and Deflate algorithms (Deutsch, 1996).  </p>
                <p>The Gridfour implementations provide moderate data compression with good
                    access speed, but there is certainly room for improvement.
                    The algorithms used in the current G93 file management software are based on work that
                    was conducted in 1993 for a project called Gem93 (the name &quot;G93&quot; was chosen as a tribute to that work).
                    Clearly, the state of the art has advanced since that time. Many interesting techniques
                    that could be applied to compressing raster data are now available. The information
                    in this document is presented with the hope that it will assist researchers and
                    developers in their own efforts to find newer and even more effective data
                    compression techniques for raster data sets.</p>
                <h2 id="g93-data-formats">G93 Data Formats</h2>
                <p>The G93 API supports 3 different formats for storing data:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Integer</li>
                    <li>Float</li>
                    <li>Integer-Coded Float</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The integer and float formats are both based on the fundamental data types used
                    by contemporary hardware and software systems. Both require 4 bytes. Floating point
                    data is stored using the IEEE-754 standard. </p>
                <p>The integer-coded float format converts floating point values to the integer format
                    by multiplying it by a scaling factor and adding an offset. This format
                    can discard some of the precision of the input float values (depending on
                    the scaling factor and the precision of the input data).  So it is, in
                    effect, a lossy representation. But, because the integer-coded float approach
                    is used for a number of publically available geophysical data sets, the G93 API
                    implements logic to support it directly.</p>
                <p>The G93 API implements lossless (non-lossy) data compression algorithms for both
                    integer and floating-point data.  The implementations for the two are much different.
                    In particular, the floating-point data compression does not take advantage of
                    the predictor methods described below. In general, floating-point data tends
                    to be less readily compressed than integer data.  This fact is sometimes a motivation
                    for using integer-coded float formats for data storage.   </p>
                <h2 id="the-etopo1-example-data-set">The ETOPO1 Example Data Set</h2>
                <p>The discussion that follows uses a data set called ETOPO1 to illustrate key points
                    related to raster data compression. ETOPO1 is a global-scale elevation and ocean depth
                    (bathymetry) data set provided on a grid defined by latitude and longitude coordinates.
                    Data is given at a uniform angular spacing of 1 minute of arc. The grid is organized
                    into 10800 rows and 21600 columns and provides over 233 million data points.
                    Elevations are given in the range -10803 meters (below mean sea level)
                    to 8333 meters (above mean sea level). ETOPO1 was selected
                    as an example for a number of reasons. First, it contains
                    a substantial number of sample points and requires enough storage space to be
                    interesting to compress. Second, the surface it describes is highly variable
                    and provides a broad spectrum of test cases ranging from flat plains,
                    to mountainous regions, to sheer drop offs along the Continental Shelf.
                    And, finally, terrain data is something that is familiar to our readers
                    and easily visualized.</p>
                <p>It should, however, be noted that G93 is intended to be a general-purpose utility
                    for processing many different kinds of grid-based data sets. It is not limited
                    to geographic or geophysical information and is certainly not limited to
                    Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). The choice of ETOPO1 was a matter of convenience
                    as much as anything else.</p>
                <h2 id="tiling-schemes-and-data-compression">Tiling Schemes and Data Compression</h2>
                <p>The grid specification for many raster data files is large enough that it is often
                    impractical to store the entire content in memory. Even with a relatively compact
                    representation using short integers, the ETOPO1 data set would require close to
                    500 megabytes of memory. So the G93 File format partitions large rasters using a tiling
                    scheme. In a tiling scheme, the grid is divided into a series of regularly sized
                    subgrids as illustrated in the figure below.</p>
                <p><img src="images/General/TilingScheme.png" alt="Tiling Scheme"> </p>
                <p>From the perspective of data compression, the tiling scheme presents two influencial features.
                    First, because tiles must be accessed independently, they are compressed individually rather
                    than as a set. In G93, tiles are compressed on a case-by-case basis. This is significant because
                    in many data sets, the statistical properties of the data tends to vary across the
                    domain of the data. Data compression techniques thrive on redundancy and self-similarity
                    in the source data. But raster data sets with larger grids allow more room for variation
                    within the data. In the ETOPO1 elevation/bathymetry example, we would expect to see very
                    different terrain (and very different data compression characteristics) over the Nullarbor Plain
                    in Australia versus the steep drop offs along the Continental Shelf. By partitioning
                    a data set into separate tiles, we reduce the tendenacy for regions of data to be compressed
                    to include a large number of dissimilar features.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, partitioning the data into smaller subgrids can have a disadvantage because
                    it reduces the overall size of a block of data to be compressed. Most practical compression
                    implementations include a certain amount of overhead beyond the storage required for the
                    actual data itself. This overhead tends to be of a more-or-less fixed size. For a small
                    data set, that overhead may comprise a significant amount of the overall storage required for
                    the data. But as the size of the data set increases, the relative contribution of the
                    overhead is reduced.</p>
                <h1 id="predictive-techniques-for-raster-data-compression">Predictive Techniques for Raster Data Compression</h1>
                <p>Data compression techniques that work well for text are often ineffective for raster data sets.
                    Virtually all data compression algorithms operate by identifying redundant elements in a data set and
                    replacing them with a more compact representation. Unfortunately, many raster data sets,
                    particularly those containing geophysical information, tend to not present
                    redundancy in a form that conventional data compression tools can exploit.  Turning to the
                    elevation example cited above, it is easy to imagine a set of sample points collected
                    along a constant slope. Each elevation value in the set would be unique. So a superficial inspection
                    of the numeric values in the set would not reveal redundant elements.  But every sample would
                    reflect the same rate of increase from point to point. And the underlying structure of the data
                    would, in fact, carry a high degree of redundancy. The key to compressing such data
                    is to transform it into a state in which the redundant elements become visible to conventional
                    data compression techniques.  </p>
                <p>Many raster compression techniques address the problem of non-compliant raster
                    data by using so called <em>predictive</em> techniques. These techniques implement
                    models that predict the value at each grid point in the raster. The residuals
                    from these predictions (actual value minus predicted value), tend to be small
                    in magnitude and more readily compressed than the source data.  Thus, in its
                    compressed form, the data is represented using the prediction parameters
                    and the compressed residuals. During decompression, these residuals are
                    used as correction factors that adjust the predicted values to match the original inputs.</p>
                <h2 id="the-simplest-predictive-technique">The Simplest Predictive Technique</h2>
                <p>The original 1993 implementation used a simple predictor which assumed that the
                    value of the raster data remained constant from grid point to grid point.
                    For that predictor, the residual was just the value of the current grid
                    point minus that of its predecessor.  The compressed form of the raster
                    data consisted of an initial <em>seed</em> value followed by a sequence of delta
                    values that could be used to recover the original representation.
                    In G93, this technique is referred to as a Differencing Predictor Model.
                    Other data compression implementations sometimes refer to it as a <em>differencing technique</em>.
                    In the original Gem93 project, the Differencing Predictor approach was inspired by
                    a description of audio delta pulse code modulation in
                    <em>The Data Compression Book</em> (Nelson, 1991, p. 346). Delta pulse coding is a well-known
                    technique that was used in the audio industry as early as the 1950’s (Chaplin, 1952).
                    While the Differencing Model predictor is not especially powerful,
                    it is easy to implement and offers excellent run-time performance.</p>
                <p>The Differencing Model predictor makes a critical assumption about the data. It assumes that
                    the values of two points closely located in space will tend to be similar.
                    In other words, it assumes that the <em>values</em> of elements that are closely located
                    spatially (i.e. in terms of grid coordinates) will also be close together numerically.
                    And, thanks to this similarity (e.g. this tendency for neighboring samples to correlate),
                    it is possible to use the values of one or more grid points to predict
                    the value of a neighbor. This assumption is generally true in real-world examples
                    such as elevation data.  We expect that two points a few hundred meters
                    apart have a higher probably of being similar than two points placed
                    far apart in much different kinds of terrain.  This idea is sometimes referred
                    to as &quot;spatial autocorrelation&quot; and has been extensively studied in
                    Geographic Information Analysis and other fields.</p>
                <p>Again let&#39;s consider the example of a set of elevation grid points specified on a
                    region with a constant slope. Because the sample points are collected at positions
                    with a uniform spacing, the difference in elevation from point-to-point is
                    constant or nearly constant. These differences are just the residuals from
                    the Differencing Predictor Model. They would exhibit a high degree of redundancy
                    and, thus, would compress to a highly compact form.</p>
                <h3 id="access-patterns-for-in-memory-data">Access Patterns for In-Memory Data</h3>
                <p>There are different ways we can construct a predictive model for raster data,
                    but all of them depend on being able to relate any particular sample
                    to its neighbors. When we consider the Differencing Predictor Model over a single
                    row of data in a grid, identifying neighbors is straight forward.
                    The relevant neighbor point is just the previous or next data point in the
                    sequence. But special handling is required when processing the transition
                    from the end of one row to the beginning of the next. If taken in sequence,
                    these two sample points will not be spatially correlated. </p>
                <p>In practice, this requirement for special handling is easily met. In the uncompressed form,
                    G93 stores grid points in row-major order (one row at a time). So in most cases,
                    the predecessor of a grid point is just the sample that preceded it in the row.
                    There is, however, one edge case that requires special handling. In row-major order,
                    the grid point that follows the last point in a row is the first point in the next row.
                    So, a predictor-residual based on the Differencing Model needs to implement
                    special handling for that transition. In G93, the following rules are applied:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The first grid point in the first row of a tile is treated as a &quot;seed&quot; value.</li>
                    <li>The difference value for each point in a row, except the first, is computed using the grid point that preceded it.</li>
                    <li>The difference values for the first grid point in all rows (except the first row), are computed using the first value in the row that preceded it.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The figure below illustrates the pattern.  The seed value is shown as a solid dot,
                    the delta values are all shown as circles. The arrows indicate which samples are
                    paired together to compute delta values.</p>
                <p><img src="images/G93Compression/CompressionPatternDifferencing.png" alt="Pattern for Differencing-Model Predictive Resolution Transform"></p>
                <p>It is worth noting that the use of the Differencing Model for raster data is not unique to this project.
                    It is used in a number of specifications including the GRIB2 raster data format
                    (NCEP 2005, table 5.6) and the TIFF image format
                    (Adobe, 1992, p. 64, &quot;Section 14: Differencing Predictor&quot;).</p>
                <h2 id="other-predictor-models">Other Predictor Models</h2>
                <p>The current version of G93 implements two additional predictor models:
                    the Linear Predictor and the Triangle Predictor.</p>
                <p>The Linear Predictor model predicts that the data varies as a linear function. The value
                    for the next sample in a sequence is predicted using a straight-line computed from the two
                    that preceded it.  The predictor is applied on a row-by-row basis. The vertical coordinate
                    of the points that precede the target point are assigned the values Z<sub>A</sub>, Z<sub>B</sub> respectively.
                    If we assume that the grid points are spaced at equal intervals,
                    then the predicted value, Z<sub>P</sub>, is given by Z<sub>P</sub> = 2xZ<sub>B</sub>-Z<sub>A</sub>.</p>
                <p>The Triangle Predictor was described by Kidner &amp; Smith (1992).  It uses three neighboring
                    points A, B, and C, to predict the value of a target sample as shown in the figure below.
                    The vertical coordinate of the points are assigned the values Z<sub>A</sub>, Z<sub>B</sub>, and Z<sub>C</sub> respectively.
                    By treating the grid as having a fixed spacing between columns, <em>s</em>, and a fixed spacing between rows, <em>t</em>,
                    the prediction computation is simplified to Z<sub>P</sub> = Z<sub>B</sub>+Z<sub>C</sub>-Z<sub>A</sub>.</p>
                <p><img src="images/G93Compression/CompressionPatternTriangle.png" alt="Pattern for Triangle-Model Predictive-Residual Transform"></p>
                <p>To see how this relationship is derived, start by taking each sample and the predicted
                    point as vectors:</p>
                <p><img src="images/G93Compression/TriangleAlgebra1.png" alt="Variables for triangle predictor"> </p>
                <p>From linear algebra, we can compute the normal to a plane and locate a point on that plane
                    using the following:</p>
                <p><img src="images/G93Compression/TriangleAlgebra2.png" alt="Variables for triangle predictor"> </p>
                <p>When we solve for Z<sub>P</sub>, the <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>s</em>, and <em>t</em> variables cancel out and we find
                    the simple computation used by the Triangle Predictor model.</p>
                <p>Both the Linear and the Triangle Predictor require special handling to initialize
                    the grid before applying the prediction computations. In the case of the Linear
                    Predictor, G93 uses the seed value and the pattern established for the Differencing
                    Predictor to pre-populate the first two columns of the grid. In the case of the
                    Triangle Predictor, the first row and first column are populated using same approach.
                    Once the grid is initialized, the specific predictors
                    can be used for the remaining grid cells.</p>
                <h2 id="serializing-the-residuals">Serializing the Residuals</h2>
                <p>Once the residuals are computed using a predictor-residual model,
                    they are passed to compression processes based on conventional data
                    compression algorithms such as the Huffman and Deflate techniques
                    described above.  Both the custom Huffman implementation included with the G93 code base
                    and the Deflate API provided as part of the standard Java library
                    are designed to process bytes. But the predictive-residual models produce output
                    in the form of integers. So in order to use them to process
                    and store the outputs from the models, the residuals must somehow be serialized
                    into a byte form. Most of the residuals tend to be close to zero, so the serialization
                    for them is trivial. In some cases, however, the residuals will be in
                    excess of the value that can be stored in a single byte.</p>
                <p>While it would be feasible to simply split out the integer residual
                    values into the component bytes, doing so would tend to dilute the
                    redundancy in the output data. Furthermore, a significant number
                    of the residuals are quite small (using the Triangle Predictor, 87.9 percent
                    of the residuals computed for ETOPO1 have an absolute value less than 15).
                    So using 4 bytes to store these small values would be wasteful.</p>
                <p>To serialize the residuals, G93 uses a scheme that it calls the M32 code.
                    M32 is an integer-to-byte coding scheme that adjusts the number of bytes
                    in the output to reflect the magnitude of each term in the input.
                    In that regard, it uses an approach similar to that used for the widely used UTF-8 character encoding.
                    As in the case of UTF-8, the first byte in the sequence
                    can represent either a literal value or a format-indicator that
                    specifies the number of bytes to follow. M32 also resembles the
                    variable-length integer code used by SQLite4 (SQLite4, 2019), except that
                    it supports negative values as well as positive. The first byte
                    in the output is essentially a hybrid value. For small-magnitude values (
                    in the range -126 to +126), it is just a signed-byte representation
                    of the input value. The values -127 and +127 are used to introduce
                    multibyte sequences. And the value -128 is used to indicate the
                    minimum 32-bit integer value, -2147483648, which Gridfour often
                    uses as a null-data code. In the multibyte sequences, the bytes that
                    follow the introducer give bits for the numerical value in
                    big-endian order. Each byte carries 7 bits of information with
                    the high-order bit used to indicate if additional bytes follow.
                    The length of the sequence depends on the magnitude of the residual
                    to be coded. In the worst case, 6 bytes are required to encode
                    large magnitude residual.</p>
                <p>The M32 coding scheme is effective in the case where the computed residuals
                    tend to be small because it preserves the one-byte-per-value relationship.
                    Again, in the case of larger residuals, the M32 code can actually be longer
                    than the 4 bytes needed for a simple integer. Fortunately, a good predictor
                    will produce small residuals. In fact, in the elevation data sets used when developing
                    G93, the average length of the M32 code sequences is
                    about 1.013 bytes per grid value.</p>
                <h1 id="compressors">Compressors</h1>
                <p>By applying the predictive-residual transformations and M32 serialization,
                    the G93 codecs transform the data to a state where it can be processed by
                    convention compressor methods. While the transformation-serialization process generally
                    reduces the size of the data (as it did for the ETOPO1 example),
                    its main benefit is that it results in a form with more
                    redundancy than the original. And as the redundancy is increased,
                    the data becomes more suitable for processing by conventional data compression techniques.</p>
                <p>As noted above, the two codecs currently implemented in G93 are based
                    on the Huffman coding and Deflate algorithms. API’s that support
                    Deflate are available in most popular software environments and
                    programming languages. G93 uses the Deflate class provided by
                    the standard Java API.  For the simpler Huffman coding,
                    G93 uses a custom implementation.</p>
                <p>During the compression phase, the current implementation of G93 attempts
                    to compress data using both codecs and all three predictive-residual transformations.
                    It then selects the serialized form that produces the smallest output size.
                    In testing with ETOPO1, the Deflate algorithm was selected in
                    about 65 percent of the tiles with Huffman being selected for the remaining 35.</p>
                <h2 id="huffman-coding">Huffman Coding</h2>
                <p>Huffman coding was originally developed for the compression of text-based data
                    and the terminology associated with it reflects that origin. For these notes,
                    we will stick to the usual conventions and refer to the sequence of data values
                    to be compressed (the M32 serialized bytes) as the &quot;text&quot;. Individual elements
                    with the sequence (each M32-serialized byte) will be described as the <em>symbols</em>.</p>
                <p>Huffman coding is based on an analysis of the frequency with which certain
                    data values (symbols) appear within the data sequence (text) to be compressed.
                    It provides an efficient way of assigning a unique sequence of bits
                    to each symbol such that the more common symbols have shorter encoding
                    sequences and the less common symbols have longer sequences.
                    Since common symbols can be encoded using short sequences,
                    the overall length of the encoded text is reduced.</p>
                <p>One consequence of this approach is that the encoded message must somehow
                    carry information about the <em>frequency table</em> for the symbols it encodes.
                    Traditional Huffman implementations provide this information directly
                    by including a symbol-frequency table at the start of the compressed
                    data sequence. Adaptive Huffman methods embed the information
                    in the compressed sequence itself. In either case, the frequency
                    information adds overhead to the encoded data.</p>
                <p>In many cases, the overhead for the frequency information has a fixed size regardless
                    of the length of the encoded text. Thus, as the length of the
                    original text increases, the proportion of the output due to
                    overhead elements decreases. So, under the Huffman encoding,
                    longer text tends to compress more efficiently than shorter text.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, in some data sets, the distribution of the symbol frequencies
                    can change over the course of the text. For example, in the ETOPO1
                    elevation data, the symbol table for a mountainous region behaves differently
                    than that collected over the plains. So if a set of elevation data set
                    contained data for both regions, a single frequency table would not provide
                    an efficient description the two separate regions. In spatial analysis,
                    this tendency of the statistical properties of data to change across
                    a data set is referred to as <em>non-stationarity</em>.</p>
                <p>These two considerations have a direct bearing on the size of the tiles specified
                    when creation a G93 file to cover a raster product with non-uniform behavior.
                    A larger tile size reduces the amount of symbol-table overhead compared
                    to the length of the encoded data. But a larger tile also allows
                    for more non-stationarity and thus dilutes the effectiveness of
                    the symbol table.  Of course, a larger tile size also increases
                    the memory use by the application.  So finding an optimal tile-size
                    choice may require some experimentation. In working with elevation data sets,
                    we have found that a tile size in the range of 10 to 40 thousand grid
                    cells tends is usually a good place to start.</p>
                <h3 id="how-g93-stores-the-huffman-tree">How G93 Stores the Huffman Tree</h3>
                <p>In the classic Huffman algorithm, the symbol-frequency table is used to create
                    a tree structure that serves as a mechanism for encoding or decoding
                    the compressed data. Although many implementations store the frequency data directly,
                    the G93 implementation gains efficiency by storing the structure of the tree itself
                    rather than retaining the actual frequency data.</p>
                <p>In the storage phase of processing, the Huffman tree is created using
                    the classic algorithm. Once established, the tree is stored according
                    to the following recursive algorithm which starts from the
                    root node of the tree.</p>

</code></pre><p>In testing with the ETOPO1 data set, there were typically about 100 unique
                    symbols in a M32-serialized tile. Storing the Huffman tree algorithm averaged
                    about 782 bits per tile.</p>
                <p>For simplicity, the tree-encoding algorithm was described above using a
                    recursive approach. In the actual code, it is implemented using a stack.
                    Although the stack-based approach leads to more complicated code,
                    it is necessary because of the potential depth of recursion that
                    might be encountered when storing the tree structure. In rare cases,
                    the depth of the Huffman tree (and thus the depth of recursive calls)
                    could reach 256, which would be too deep for some Java JVM’s.
                    Thus a safe implementation required the use of a stack.</p>
                <h2 id="arithmetic-coding">Arithmetic Coding</h2>
                <p>Kidner and Smith (2003) demonstrated improvement in compression ratios by using
                    arithmetic coding rather than Huffman codes. Because arithmetic coding reflects
                    the frequency distribution of symbols in the compressed data more accurately than
                    Huffman, it can achieve better compression ratios than Huffman.
                    Unfortunately, implementing arithmetic coding is more complicated than
                    implementing Huffman coding.  Arithmetic also encoders tend to require
                    more processing time than Huffman.</p>
                <p>As an experiment, we implemented a compression codes using the Reference Implementation
                    of an adaptive arithmetic encoder (Nayuki, 2020). During the test, we
                    replaced the Huffman codec with the arithmetic codec, but retained the Deflate codec.
                    The relative number of tiles for which arithmetic coding was selected remained roughly
                    the same as for the Huffman case described above. But the arithmetic encoder
                    reduced the size of the compressed data by about 2 percent. On the other hand,
                    arithmetic coding required more processing time than Huffman.</p>

                <p>It is worth noting that the Reference Implementation focuses on correctness
                    of implementation and clarity of code, so lacks some optimizations that
                    would tend to complicate or obscure the logic. So, there may be opportunities
                    for reducing the processing time. Arithmetic coding may be the subject
                    of future investigation for the G93 project.  </p>
                <h1 id="future-work">Future Work</h1>
                <p>The introduction to this wiki page made the claim that the G93 package is intended
                    to serve as a testbed for investigators and software developers who wish to
                    experiment with their own solutions for raster data compression. We hope that by
                    describing the current implementations, we demonstrated some of the reasons that
                    we think that claim is valid.</p>
                <p>There are many, many promising avenues to explore for better solutions
                    to the raster data compression problem. Kidner and Smith (2003) used a more
                    power predictor based on Legrange multipliers and arithmetic coding.
                    Some commercial solutions (and the JPEG 2000 standard) have explored
                    the use of wavelet functions. Data compression continues to be an area
                    of active interest in the software community, and we fully expect that
                    new techniques are waiting to be discovered.</p>
                <p>The G93 project is especially interested in lossless, or nearly lossless, techniques
                    for compressing real-valued data.  The current G93 implementation implements compression
                    for floating point data, but the results are not as successful as they are for integers.</p>
                <p>If you are investigating raster-based data compression, we wish you the best
                    of luck and hope that insights from G93 can help you on your way. And, as always,
                    we welcome your ideas and suggestions.</p>
