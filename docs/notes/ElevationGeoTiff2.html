                    Part 2: Color, Land Cover, and Surface Water
                </p>


                <h1>Introduction</h1>

                <p><a href="https://gwlucastrig.github.io/gridfour/notes/ElevationGeoTiff1.html">Part 1 of this series</a>
                    introduced the U.S. Geological Survey’s Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) data product and showed how its
                    elevation data could be used to produce shaded-relief imagery. It also
                    introduced the Apache Commons Imaging API, a software library that supports
                    data access to GeoTIFF data products. So far, the techniques that I discussed
                    were limited to the production of monochrome imagery.  Adding color to a
                    shaded-relief image allows it to convey information about climate, land cover,
                    surface water, and other natural features.  </p>

                <p>In this article, we will explore ways of adding color to
                    shaded-relief imagery through the use of simple elevation-based palettes as
                    well as more realistic techniques using supplemental data sources. We will take
                    these techniques one step at a time. The text that follows includes the following sections:</p>

					</ul>


                   <p>But before we get started, let’s take a
                    look at the kind of result we can expect. </p>

                <p>The picture below shows a color-enhanced rendering of the
                    same San Jacinto sample area that was featured in the previous article. The sample
                    covers a one-degree square area in Riverside County in Southern California that
                    includes the San Jacinto Mountains, the Coachella Valley, and part of the
                    Salton Sea. As in the previous article, all images were produced using the
                    Commons Imaging API and the DemoCOG application. Source code for DemoCOG is
                    available at the
                    <a href="https://gwlucastrig.github.io/gridfour/">Gridfour software project</a>.
                </p>


                <p> </p>

                <figure>
                    <img width=751 height=981 src="ElevationGeoTiff2_files/image001.jpg">
                    <figcaption>Figure 1 &ndash; Color-enhanced shaded-relief image from Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (data source: USGS, Patterson).</figcaption>
                </figure>




                <p>The part of Southern California depicted in the image
                    features sparse vegetation and is mostly arid though it does receive seasonal
                    precipitation in the mountains. The distribution of snow and rainfall is
                    clearly visible from the patches of green scattered over the higher-elevation areas.
                    The assignment of terrestrial coloration was taken from a raster-based
                    land-cover data set provided by the 100-Meter Natural Earth Data product (Patterson, 2020).
                    The land-cover product will be discussed below. The surface-water
                    features come from Shapefile (polygon) data sources downloaded from the U.S.
                    Geological Survey National Atlas (USGS, 2020).</p>

                <h2 id="assigning-color-by-elevation">Assigning color by elevation</h2>

                <p>Lacking access to supplemental data sources, it is feasible
                    to add color to a shaded-relief image strictly on the basis of elevation. To do
                    so, we specify a palette tied to elevation intervals and apply it to the image
                    processing.  In the pictures below, I used a palette that was developed by the
                    National Oceanographic and Atmospheric and Administration (NOAA) for its global-scale
                    ETOPO1 elevation and bathymetry data set (NOAA, 2020).  In the ETOPO1 palette,
                    elevations at or below sea level are shown in shades of blue. Lower elevations
                    are shown in green. And higher elevations are shown in tan or white.</p>

                <p>As the pictures below show, the idea falls apart
                    quickly when we compare the results to a reference source such as the Terrain
                    view from Google Maps (Google, 2020).</p>


                <figure>
                    <img width=780 height=542  src="ElevationGeoTiff2_files/image002.jpg">
                    <figcaption>Figure 2 &ndash; Result of simple elevation palette compared to reference image (data source: USGS, Google).</figcaption>
                </figure>



                <p>There are two problems with the naïve application of a
                    color palette.  First, the traditional assignment of shades of green to
                    low-lying regions gives a misleading impression of the land-cover. In this
                    case, the arid, near-desert regions in the sample area are shown in a verdant
                    green tone that implies abundant vegetation. Second, the fact that a large
                    portion of the San Jacinto sample area lies below Mean Sea Level (MSL) results
                    in dry land being colored in shades of blue.  Consequently, much of the arid Coachella
                    Valley appears to be covered with water.  If the rendering were to be believed,
                    the town of Coachella itself, which lies at 21 meters below sea level, would be
                    entirely submerged. </p>

                <p>Of course, it is possible to adjust the palette so that the
                    water colors start at a lower elevation. For the panel below on the right, I
                    tweaked the intervals so that the blue colors started at 70.1 meters below MSL.
                    That value produces a blue area that matches the shoreline of the Salton Sea, a well-known
                    saltwater lake. It can be interpreted as the elevation of the surface of that body of water.
                    But the elevation of 70.1 meters below MSL does not agree with any published value for the
                    surface of the Salton Sea that I was able to find. The value I used was obtained through several
                    rounds of trial and error.

                <p>So, as the panel shows, a custom palette can help improve the
                    accuracy of a color-coded elevation rendering. But, while creating a palette to
                    fit a particular sample area is feasible, it is tedious at best and still prone
                    to error. It also fails to capture any lakes or reservoirs that may occur at
                    higher elevations. For that purpose, we need additional data sources such as
                    the surface-water Shapefiles that will be discussed below.</p>

                <h2 id="land-cover-color">Adding land-cover color values from a GeoTIFF</h2>

                <p>Let's see what we can do to improve the depiction of the San Jacinto data sample.
                    The first thing we’re going to take care of is the depiction
                    of land-cover. To that end, we turn to Tom Patterson’s Natural Earth Map Data
                    collections.  Mr. Patterson’s work is extraordinary both for its technical merit
                    and for his generosity in offering it free-of-charge and in the public domain.
                    There are actually two Natural Earth products.  The primary
                    Natural Earth Data website includes land-cover GeoTIFF images for the whole Earth at a
                    moderate resolution (Natural Earth Data, 2020). But there is also a larger scale set of images
                    giving land-cover for the United States at a 100-meter resolution at Mr. Patterson's website
                    <a href="http://shadedrelief.com/NE_100m/">http://shadedrelief.com/NE_100m/</a>.
                    We will use this higher resolution product because it is closer to the
                    map scale used for the elevation data in the Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF products.</p>

                <p>The land-cover imagery is a much different kind of GeoTIFF
                    than the USGS elevation product that we discussed in 
					<a href="https://gwlucastrig.github.io/gridfour/notes/ElevationGeoTiff1.html">Part 1 of this series</a>.
                    For one thing, it includes a conventional RGB image product rather than numerical elevation
                    data. It also uses a Projected Coordinate System (PCS) rather than the
                    Geographic Coordinate System (GCS) used by the USGS products. In a projected
                    coordinate system, the pixels represent positions on the Earth that are
                    transformed to an imaging plane using a map projection.  The advantage to this
                    approach is that the projected image can preserve important features such as
                    area, distance, or shape that are not well represented by geographic coordinate
                    systems. </p>

                <p>You may recall that for the elevation data set we used in
                    Part 1, we needed to narrow the image area in order to preserve the shape of
                    features on the surface of the Earth. A projected coordinate system does the
                    same kind of thing, but it does it using a much more accurate (and complex)
                    transformation. </p>

                <p>Let’s look briefly at the content of the GeoKeyDirectoryTag
                    for the file W_CONUS_100m_NE_LC.tif</p>

                <pre>

                </pre>


                <p>In this data set, key 1024 (GtModelTypeKey) has the value 1,
                    indicating that the GeoTIFF uses a projected coordinate system. Key 3072 (projected
                    coordinate reference system geo key) refers to the European Petroleum Survey
                    Group (EPSG) map projection database specification number 5070 (EPSG, 2020). 
                    Although this particular GeoTIFF does not give a full set of parameters for the
                    map projection it uses, we can look it up the necessary elements from external
                    sources. The ESPG system is well known and its specifications are readily
                    available on the Internet. ESPG map projection 5070 is an Albers Equal Area
                    Conic map projection optimized for depicting features in the Contiguous United
                    States (CONUS).</p>

                <p>The fact that the substantial majority of GIS analysis is
                    conducted using a projected coordinate system is not due to a love of
                    complexity. Rather, it is because working on a plane-based coordinate system is
                    so much easier than performing analysis over the surface of the spheroidal
                    Earth. Transforming coordinates onto a projected plane simplifies the
                    mathematics for geospatial computations (area, distance, and angle) and also
                    transforms features into a form that is visually closer to their real-world
                    counterparts. The downside to this approach is that because the Natural Earth
                    Land-Cover data set uses a projected coordinate system, we need an
                    implementation of a map projection in order to correlate the geographic
                    coordinates from the Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs with the pixel positions in the
                    land-cover image.</p>

                <p>In the previous article, we discussed how the GeoTIFF
                    metadata allowed us to transform the raster coordinates from the source data to
                    geographic (latitude, longitude) coordinates and permitted the data to be registered
                    with real-world locations. That coordinate conversion was accomplished using a
                    simple scale and offset transformation (an affine transformation). To register
                    the elevation with the land-cover GeoTIFF, we need to perform two more
                    transformations. First we need to map geographic coordinates to the map
                    projection coordinate system defined by the land-cover GeoTIFF. Then we need to
                    use an affine transformation to scale and offset the projected coordinates to
                    the raster coordinate system. Once we have mapped coordinates from the raster
                    elevation product to the corresponding raster coordinates for Natural Earth
                    GeoTIFF, we can access the pixels in the land-cover imagery to find the color
                    values associated with each elevation grid cell.  The transformation chain is
                    summarized below.</p>

                <p><img width=780 height=127
                        src="ElevationGeoTiff2_files/image004.png"></p>



                <p>For the DemoCOG implementation, I elected to write my own
                    implementation of the Albers Equal Area Conic map projection used by
                    the Natural Earth GeoTIFF. While general purpose map-projection APIs are available
                    on the web, I didn’t want to add yet another software dependency to the demonstration
                    application. So I wrote a single class to perform the forward transform
                    (geographic to projected) that the demonstration application required.
                    Fortunately, the Albers is not very complicated as map projections go.  Formulas
                    for the transformation are given in John P. Snyder’s classic book “Map
                    projections – a working manual” (Snyder, 1987). Although coding Mr. Snyder’s
                    formulas required care, it was not difficult.</p>

                <p>The full size of the Natural Earth Land-Cover GeoTIFF for
                    the western half of the United States is quite large, 25403 by 31390 pixels.
                    Fortunately, the Commons Imaging API allows us to access just the subset of the
                    image that we actually need.  So, loading the land-cover imagery associated
                    with the area of interest for our shaded-relief image is just a matter of using
                    the following steps:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Using the Albers Equal Area map projection, transform the geographic coordinates for
                        the four corners of the San Jacinto data product to pixel coordinates in the
                        land-cover imagery.</li>

                    <li>Use the pixel coordinates to determine the bounds of the sub image
                        required for rendering.</li>

                    <li>Load the sub image.</li>

                    <li>For each raster cell in the shaded-relief image:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Find the geographic coordinates of the raster cell</li>

                            <li>Map the geographic coordinates to pixel coordinates in the land-cover
                                sub image (because the elevation data set has 10-meter spacing while the
                                land-cover data set has 100-meter spacing, this result will be a fractional
                                value, often falling between pixels).</li>

                            <li>Interpolate the color values for the output pixel coordinates.</li>

                            <li>Apply the color to the shaded-relief imagery.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>

                <p>The picture below shows the raw image extracted from the
                    Land-Cover GeoTIFF (left) and the result when the image is combined with shaded-relief
                    data created from the USGS elevation data set. One natural phenomenon that the
                    Natural Earth Land-Cover image doesn’t depict is surface water. We will discuss
                    technique for adding that information next.</p>

                <h2 id="surface-water">Surface water and shapefiles</h2>

                <p>You may be wondering why Mr. Patterson decided to omit
                    surface water from his land-cover imagery. It turns out that removing
                    surface-water features allows application to use alternate data sources that
                    can provide better results. The 100-meter pixel spacing for the Natural Earth
                    GeoTIFF is adequate for land-cover. But most surface water features included on
                    maps are drawn at a much higher resolution than that. Omitting surface water
                    from the Land-Cover depiction leaves developers and cartographers free to use
                    other sources. And, because surface water data in the form of Shapefile
                    (polygon) data products is easy to come by, omitting it from a land-cover
                    product is not an obstacle for its users. Mr. Patterson himself recommends
                    surface water Shapefile products from the USGS National Atlas (USGS, 2020).    </p>

                <p>A Shapefile is an industry standard GIS data format that
                    represents an area-based feature such as lake as a polygon defined by a series
                    of using spatial coordinates that define its vertices. For this article,
                    Shapefiles from the National Atlas were downloaded from the Earth Explorer
                    website (USGS, 2020).  To extract data from these files for rendering, the
                    demonstration application uses an API from the open-source Tinfour software
                    product (Tinfour, 2020).   The results were shown in the larger-scale image
                    that introduced this article.</p>

                <h2 id="color-models">Color models</h2>

                <p>The Natural Earth Land-Cover GeoTIFF uses a conventional RGB
                    (Red-Green-Blue) color model. If you look through the DemoCOG code, you may be
                    surprised by the complexity of the color processing used to interpolate those
                    RGB values to populate the output image. The DemoCOG application uses an alternate
                    color model known as CIELAB (“CIELAB color space”, Wikipedia,  n.d.).  While the RGB color
                    model is well suited for the implementation of computer monitors and display
                    hardware, the CIELAB model is a closer match for the way the human eye perceives color.
                    Thus the CIELAB model can produce better results when blending colors.  The
                    Apache Commons Imaging API includes a set of utilities for converting between
                    the RGB color space (which is used by the source image and output display) and
                    the CIELAB model. The DemoCOG application takes advantage of these conversions
                    for its color manipulation and processing.</p>

                <p>That being said, I do not wish to overstate the case for
                    using the alternate CIELAB model rather than working directly from RGB. The
                    color palette used to the Natural Earth Land-Cover imagery works well in both
                    systems. As the panels below show, the CIELAB treatment produces somewhat richer
                    colors and enhanced contrast. But the differences are subtle. </p>

                <h2 id="dealing-with-shoreline">Dealing with shoreline and coastal areas</h2>

                <p>Although the San Jacinto data set includes a number of
                    interesting features, it lies well inland and does not include shoreline or
                    ocean areas.  For an example of an area that includes coastal waters, we turn
                    to another Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF downloaded from the USGS.  The image below
                    was constructed from data for an area that covers Western Connecticut and a
                    section of Southeastern New York State.   It includes the U.S. Military Academy
                    at West Point, the town of Sleepy Hollow in New York, the Connecticut cities of
                    Norwalk, Danbury and Waterbury, as well as Lake Candlewood and numerous other
                    lakes and rivers. The blue strip on the left side of the image is the Hudson
                    River. </p>

                <p>New York and Connecticut receive reasonably regular rainfall
                    and snow. Consequently, the land-cover depiction is much greener than for the
                    area near the San Jacinto mountain range. The Northeast U.S. area shown above
                    is also much more urbanized than the San Jacinto area. The Natural Earth Land
                    Cover data set uses gray tints to show built-up areas, so most of the coastal
                    area from Connecticut is drawn in gray. </p>

                <p>Geologically, the Western Connecticut sample area is much
                    older than the San Jacinto area. Its hilly terrain is the result of millions of
                    years of weathering and was significantly modified by glaciation during the ice
                    age. Some of the effects of that modification are revealed by the shaded-relief
                    rendering, most notably the shaping of the north-south orientated ridges and
                    valleys across the region.  </p>

                <figure>
                    <img width=752 height=1080   src="ElevationGeoTiff2_files/image007.jpg">
                    <figcaption>Figure 7 &ndash; An elevation GeoTIFF that includes coastal and ocean areas (data source: USGS).</figcaption>
                </figure>


                <p>The coverage of the Natural Earth Land-Cover imagery does
                    not extend into the ocean area. Where the land-cover information ends, the tint
                    imagery supplies white pixel values. In most cases, the DemoCOG application
                    assigns output pixels a blue color where elevations lie at or below sea level. But
                    because of the elevation raster has so much greater resolution than the
                    land-cover imagery, there are occasional conflicts in the data. Sometimes,
                    pixels with elevations indicating that they should be land positions happen to
                    fall over the white area in the Natural Earth product. Because they are
                    identified as land pixels, the rendering application would ordinarily take the
                    color value from Natural Earth. But if it were to do so, the result would be a
                    speckling of white pixels along the shore line as shown in the panels below.  To
                    correct for such cases, DemoCOG implements logic to extend land tints outward
                    from the coastline.</p>

                <h1>Conclusion</h1>

                <p>The U.S. Geological Survey’s Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG)
                    products provide a valuable source of high-resolution elevation data that can
                    be downloaded free-of-charge. There are many potential applications for the
                    USGS elevation data. This article focuses on one of them: the creation of
                    shaded-relief map imagery. </p>

                <p>Discussing shaded-relief imagery gave us an opportunity to
                    explore the underlying concepts used in GeoTIFF files. It also gave us an
                    opportunity to exercise some of these concepts through the implementation of a
                    data access and map rendering tool called DemoCOG.</p>

                <p>DemoCOG uses the Apache Commons Imaging software library to
                    access GeoTIFF files and obtain the three fundamental data elements necessary
                    to perform shaded-relief rendering: raster-based elevation data, geolocation
                    metadata, and georeferenced imagery (the Natural Earth land-cover information).
                     Commons Imaging also provided the color-space conversion tools that allowed
                    DemoCOG to perform optimal color-blending and interpolation operations. The
                    source code for the DemoCOG application is available from the Gridfour Software
                    Project. Although DemoCOG is implemented in the Java programming language, its
                    code includes plenty of comments and is written to be accessible to readers who
                    are unfamiliar with Java.  </p>

                <p>I hope you’ve found this series of articles useful. Although
                    the GeoTIFF format can seem overwhelmingly complex at first, it is based on a
                    logical series of design choices that make it manageable once you delve into
                    it. I wish you success in working with GeoTIFF products and the Apache Commons
                    Image software library.</p>
