                <h1 id="background">Background</h1>
                <p>Although there are many tools for image processing and gridded-data applications,
                    the Gridfour Project believes that there is still
                    a need for general-purpose software utilities for the processing of raster (grid)
                    products. Potential applications in these areas run the gamut from rendering,
                    data compression, contouring, surface analysis, and other operations aimed
                    at analyzing and understanding data stored in raster form.</p>
                <h1 id="our-inspiration">Our Inspiration</h1>
                <p>Recently, there has been a lot of news about the <a href="https://seabed2030.gebco.net/">Seabed 2030 Project</a> . That ambitious
                    undertaking aims to map 100 percent of the ocean floor by 2030. To put that in perspective,
                    the project organizers estimate that, today, only about 20 percent of the world&#39;s oceans are fully
                    mapped (see <a href="https://seabed2030.gebco.net/faq/#q4">Seabed 2030, FAQ</a>). So there&#39;s a lot of work to be done
                    in the next decade.</p>
                <p>One thing is certain, the existence of projects like Seabed 2030 will result in massive collections
                    of grid-based (raster) data sets. Seabed 2030 itself will include about 7.6 billion grid points <a href="#note1">&#91;1&#93;</a>.
                    There is a need for software libraries that can assist in
                    the processing of that data. In particular, we see a need for more efficient techniques for storage
                    and data compression for grid data. That need inspired us to create Gridfour.</p>
                <h1 id="an-old-idea-made-new">An Old Idea Made New</h1>
                <p>The first module created for the Gridfour Software Project is the Gridfour Virtual Raster System (GVRS).
				    GVRS is a grid-based data compression and file management module. The GVRS API helps Java applications
                    manage raster (grid) data in situations where the size of the data exceeds what
                    could reasonably be kept in memory. It also provides a file-based utility for
                    the persistent storage of data between runs. And, finally, it includes custom
                    data compression that significantly reduces the storage size required for
                    raster data.</p>

                <p>Some of the data-compression algorithms used in GVRS have been around for a long time
                    They were originally developed for a project named Gem93 that was
                    completed in 1993. Gem93 included a number of tools for working with raster data, among them a lossless data compression technique
                    inspired by the work of Kidner and Smith (1992). You can read more about them at our project documentation
                    <a href="https://gwlucastrig.github.io/gridfour/notes/GridfourDataCompressionAlgorithms.html">Lossless Raster Compression Algorithms</a>.</p>
                <p>Of course, the state of the art has advanced quite a bit since 1993. And although
                    the foundation for GVRS comes from old ideas, we hope you find that our API provides a fresh take
					on their implementation. We intend our GVRS library to provide
                    a convenient tool for investigators developing new techniques for compressing
                    geophysical and scientific data in raster form. GVRS makes it very easy to
                    extend the Gridfour code and add new data compression capabilities &#40; to see
                    just how easy it is, visit our wiki page at
                    <a href="https://github.com/gwlucastrig/gridfour/wiki/How-to-Register-a-Custom-Data-Compressor">Custom Data Compressors</a> &#41;.
                    Our hope is that by providing GVRS, we will help investigators
                    focus on their own research and leave the details of memory and file-management to
                    the Gridfour API.</p>
                <h3 id="help-wanted">Help Wanted</h3>
                <p>We are finishing up the initial implementation of GVRS. We are looking for
                    developers interested in porting it to additional languages
                    (such as C#, C++, Rust) and creating Python bindings. We are also looking for
                    users with ideas for new features and how to apply the library. </p>
                <h1 id="things-to-come">Things to Come</h1>
                <p>The Gridfour Software Project is still in its infancy. There is a lot
                    of opportunity for new ideas and new software development. In the future
                    we hope to include implementations of contouring, statistical analysis,
                    and physical modeling logic to our collection. We are also building tools to
                    simplify access to data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission &#40; <a href="https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/">SRTM</a> &#41;
                    and the U.S. Geological Survey&#39;s high-resolution National Elevation Dataset
                    &#40; <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/usgs-national-elevation-dataset-ned">NED</a> &#41;.</p>

                <p>Finally, we end with a picture that was created using the Gridfour API and a set of elevation
                    and bathymetry data taken from the GEBCO_2019 global data set. The picture
                    shows a shaded-relief rendering of the Island of Hokkaido, Japan.
                    GEBCO_2019 was one of the data sets used for the initial GVRS implementation and a good example of the
                    potential of systems like it. Color-coding was based on elevation obtained from a GVRS file
                    and shading was computed using the surface normal obtained with Gridfour's B-Spline raster interpolation class.
                    The GVRS data compression reduces the size of this data set down to about 17.2 percent of
                    its original size (see <a href="https://gwlucastrig.github.io/gridfour/notes/Gvrs_Performance.html">GVRS Performance</a>
                    for more details). Future work may bring about more improvements.</p>
